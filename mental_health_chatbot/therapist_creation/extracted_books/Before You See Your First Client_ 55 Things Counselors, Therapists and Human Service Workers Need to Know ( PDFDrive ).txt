xi                            
                                     Introduction           
             This is the book I’ve always wanted to write and the book
           I’m convinced that you — as a student or practitioner —
           always wanted to read. This text begins where others leave
           off. It provides a candid behind-the-scenes look at the field
           of counseling and human services that you can immediately
           begin using to help yourself, your agency, and your clients.
           You will note that since nearly everything included in these
           pages was learned via my experience you won’t find the
           pages cluttered with references to journal articles or schol-
           arly tomes.                                      
             In the mid-1970s when I entered the mental/social service
           arena, I was armed to the teeth with information from my
           college and graduate classes. I was familiar with an array of
           theories, the theorists behind them, and enough clinical and
           research concepts to fill three-and-a-half dresser drawers
           with my class notes.                             
             Unfortunately, I knew precious little about the real world
           of helping. I guess you could say I was anything but street
           smart when it came to life on the therapeutic playing field.
           Nearly every other neophyte worker I came in contact with
           was just as naive as I was. I can’t tell you how many times
           in the last few years I have lamented, “If I knew then what
           I know now.”                                     
             This book is intended to share what I’ve learned about a
           host of important topics that are conspicuously missing from
           many other texts, courses, and workshops in the field. This
           book will not teach you about the tenets of behavior therapy,
           Piaget’s developmental stages, or the rudiments of effica-
           cious research. It will, nevertheless, provide you with vital
           practical information regarding clinical work and policy
           issues.

=== Page 13 (1 cols) ===
xii                            
            I have tried to keep this work brutally frank and I don’t
          pull any punches. I share insider information about the good
          — why you could make a sizeable chunk of change by being
          assertive when it comes to your salary, the bad — why many
          psychiatrists will rarely refer to nonmedical therapists, the
          ugly — you can be the most qualified candidate for an
          agency job and still have absolutely no chance of securing
          it, and the politics — why managed care firms will not allow
          you to use some of the theories you learned in school. Please
          remember that if you don’t like everything that I say … well,
          I don’t like everything I say either. I’m just reporting what
          occurs. I don’t make the rules. While I sometimes don’t like
          what goes on in the helping professions, I feel that as a
          professional, or a future professional, you have a right to
          know. Also keep in mind that some helpers and agencies
          would never engage in some of the distasteful practices I
          share in the confines of these pages.             
            Like any other field, there are some really terrific people
          and some questionable individuals who go into the helping
          professions. If, for example, you have a less than desirable
          experience with a hospital social worker, don’t automatically
          assume that all hospital social workers and all hospital per-
          sonnel are difficult to work with. Agencies, hospitals,
          schools, organizations, and institutions are made up of peo-
          ple. Don’t jump to the conclusion that a given agency or
          institution is bad or for that matter good based on your
          interaction with a single individual.             
            One paradoxical factor is that the good, the bad, the ugly,
          and the politics of helping are relative. You’ll learn, for
          example, that the same psychiatrist who would never make
          a referral to you (no matter how qualified you are), will
          necessarily be making a slew of referrals to another non-
          medical therapist who will think the psychiatrist’s policy is
          wonderful. And why not?

xiii                          
             As this book goes to print, the issue of managed care is
           undoubtedly the hottest, most controversial topic in the field.
           Did you know that the same managed care firms who will
           not allow you to use certain theories you learned in school
           are some of the largest employers of counselors, addiction
           specialists, social workers, psychologists, and other human
           service personnel? Hence, every coin has two sides and your
           perception of whether my ideas are positive or negative will
           undoubtedly depend on your personal vantage point. Some
           experts are producing books and workshops that tell you
           how to partner yourself with managed care while others are
           promoting ideas you can use to create a sane agency or
           private practice that is managed-care free! A practitioner, for
           example, who has seen clients and helpers blatantly abuse
           the system might legitimately cherish the constraints imple-
           mented by managed care firms. A practitioner or agency that
           has lost extensive business as a result of this model will most
           likely oppose managed care.                      
             Recently, I gave a presentation to a group of counseling
           students who had received academic honors and were ready
           to graduate with master’s degrees. The information I shared
           with them was a condensed version of what appears in this
           text. I was astonished at the sheer number of students who
           approached me after the lecture and told me that they had
           never heard any of the material before. Most surprising,
           however, was the fact that the professor who invited me to
           speak — who was primarily an academician, rather than a
           clinician — sheepishly admitted that all my gems of wisdom
           were also new to him. It was at this point that I knew I had
           to write this book. It was a necessity rather than a luxury.
             You’ll note that the material is replete with a generous
           supply of actual examples. This text will thus provide a real

            The descriptions and names of clients, practitioners, and
          agencies have been altered to protect their identities and
          confidentiality. Any similarities between real persons and/or

            Again, please keep in mind that most practitioners/agen-

            Close your eyes — yes, right this moment — and imagine
          this dream-come-true scenario. You decide to go into private
          practice. You are sitting in a nice office, perhaps some would
          even describe it as plush, with a large oak desk, comfortable
          chairs, and thick deep-pile carpeting. You have a cli-
          ent-friendly waiting room, stocked with the latest issues of
          the most popular magazines. Soft soothing background
          music is piped in to further relax and comfort your clients.
          But wait, it gets even better. You have a kind efficient recep-
          tionist who answers your phone calls, books your appoint-
          ments, files your clients’ charts, keeps your office stocked
          with pens, stationery, business cards, and even does most of
          your insurance paperwork. Even more impressive is the fact
          that you have a steady stream of referrals provided for you
          day after day, week after week, year after year. And best of

          Before You See Your First Client                  
          all, everything I’ve described is paid for by somebody else!
          And in many cases that somebody else is the local psychi-
          atrist. In other words, you’re not risking a single solitary
          dime of your own money.                           
            Too good to be true you say? Think again! Many coun-
          selors and therapists wrongly assume that psychiatrists don’t
          believe in counseling, therapy, or testing and don’t make
          referrals. The truth is, however, that many psychiatrists will
          do everything depicted in the aforementioned fantasy — and
          more — if they find a nonmedical helper they trust.
            Neophyte counselors fresh out of graduate school or
          those who are new to private practice are often surprised to
          discover that some (though certainly not all) psychiatrists
          will only refer to a counselor or therapist with whom they
          have a financial arrangement. By a financial arrangement, I
          mean that the psychiatrist will collect a sizable amount of
          money for every client the therapist sees. This, of course,
          means that the psychiatrist could be sunning and funning in
          the Bahamas while you are pumping up his or her bank
          account by seeing clients. It is commonplace for a psychia-
          trist to take 40 or even 50 percent of the money collected.
          That is to say, if you see a client for $80, then you will
          receive $40 less taxes as does the psychiatrist. Since the act
          of “fee splitting” is often deemed unethical, the psychiatrist’s
          attorney or accountant will generally have you sign a con-
          tract that stipulates that you are paying 50 percent for the
          use of the office, billing services, and the office staff. This
          is often referred to as a percentage cut or a percentage split.
            Keep in mind that the counselor would not be getting
          any of these referrals if he or she was not associated with
          the psychiatrist in question. Moreover, it is the psychiatrist,
          not you, who is taking the risk and virtually paying for
          everything necessary to run the practice. The only thing you
          can lose is your time. Thus, depending upon how you look
          at it, these so-called percentage cuts can be a good deal for

         the counselor as well as the psychiatrist. Moreover, nonmed-
         ical therapists are now following in the footsteps of psychi-
         atrists and are offering percentage cuts to colleagues — even
         psychiatrists — who need office space, administrative ser-
         vices, and/or help securing clients. The trick to securing a
         risk-free private practice is to be assertive. Don’t be afraid
         to approach a psychiatrist or other professional to make your
         dream a reality.

                           Single Referral Source           
            Ah, the good old days. Susan Gladstone can remember
          a time when she was proud of her private practice and rightly
          so. In a three-month period she once snared 148 new refer-
          rals, commendable by any standard.                
            The good news was that all the referrals came from a
          single source: the inpatient stress unit down the street. The
          bad news is that about two years ago the unit shut down.
            Today Susan now has a caseload she can count on one
          hand. Three clients to be exact. Susan, like many therapists,
          was dependent on a single referral source for her client base.
          Private practitioners, agencies, and hospitals must never be
          dependent — or married, if you will — to one source for
          their clients.                                    
            Diversify. Branch out. Network, even when you’re doing
          well, because a marriage to a single referral source is never
          a marriage made in heaven.

            Needless to say I was fit to be tied when I marched —
          no, make that stormed — into my supervisor two’s office. I
          had discovered much to my chagrin that three of my workers
          were making more than I was as their supervisor!  
            My supervisor listened intently to my tale of woe and
          then barked back at me. “How in the heck could I feel
          empathy for you? I’m a supervisor two and all of my super-
          visor ones, including you, are making more than I am.”
            I had to admit I could see her point. Albert Ellis, the
          father of Rational-Emotional Behavioral Therapy, has
          warned us of the dire consequences of demanding that the
          world be fair and perhaps nowhere is unfairness more evi-
          dent than in social service positions.            
            I’ll never forget the day I received a call from a practicum
          student of mine some years ago. She had secured a master’s

          degree with a perfect 4.0 straight-A grade point average and
          had secured a position as a counselor in a chemical depen-
          dency unit of a hospital.                         
            After four years of dedicated service she came across a
          horrendous fact that was so shocking she almost choked. As
          a master’s level therapist her pay scale range was from
          $18,256 to $24,777. The scale for counselors who were
          recovering from an addiction was $25,333 to $41,566. In
          case you missed the point, the top salary for my ex-student,
          and others who possessed a master’s degree, was less than
          the lowest possible salary for an individual who was in
          recovery! Ouch! Worse yet, those who were recovering were
          not required to have any minimal level of education. Some
          had never graduated high school!                  
            “I should have lied about my credentials when I took the
          job,” she told me. “I should have told them that I dropped
          out of grammar school and spent the sixties whacked out on
          a drug high.”                                     
            Although it has been years since I marched into my
          supervisor’s office, one thing remains the same. Salaries in
          mental health, social service, and education are often still
          grossly unfair.

            Herbert Spencer was the perfect employee and everyone
          was sad to see him leave. After 19 years of dedicated service
          Herb was knocking down $33,500 a year. He was repeatedly
          reminded he was worth a lot more, but the agency could not
          afford to pay him more on a limited not-for-profit budget. It
          certainly sounded reasonable to Herb and he accepted the
          explanation regarding his salary cap like a true gentleman.
            One day after Herb retired the agency began the hiring
          process. Ann Jefferson interviewed for the job. To say that
          the hiring committee was impressed would be putting it
          mildly. There was only one problem. Although the salary
          range of the job was listed at $25,000 to $33,500 (Herb’s
          salary), Ann made it clear that she had no intention of taking
          the job for under $35,000.

          Before You See Your First Client                  
            The verdict? Ann began the job making $1,500 a year
          more than Herb who spent a major part of his career serving
          the agency.                                       
            Is this fair? No, but as you know, salaries are often unfair
          in this field. Do the Herbs of this world know this goes on?
          Rarely, and if they did they would generally feel used and
          cheated.                                          
            Although large agencies, hospitals, clinics, and govern-
          ment jobs may have salary ranges that are set in stone a lot
          of sites in this field decidedly do not. Therefore, it is imper-
          ative to remember that it always pays to be assertive when
          shopping for a salary. Also, never forget that you (and per-
          haps even Ann Jefferson) could truly be superior to the
          former employee such as Herb, despite his or her years and
          years of service.                                 
            The bottom line on this one is crystal clear: If you’re
          worth more money, say so!

            Marty was armed with prestigious credentials — a Ph.D.
          from a private school, a state counselor’s license, and a
          certification in mental health.                   
            During the day Marty works for the men’s counseling
          center at a large hospital. Here he is qualified to see clients
          from the Brand X Health Care plan. At night, he has his own
          little private practice. Since the Brand X program is
          extremely popular, Marty gets a sizable number of calls from
          clients at his own practice who belong to the program. When
          Marty called Brand X to verify insurance benefits he was
          told that he was not a bona fide provider when performing
          therapy at his private practice office.           
            Simple enough, he thought. I’ll merely apply as a pro-
          vider from my private practice address. Much to Marty’s
          chagrin, he was rejected as a provider! Marty screamed foul

          play. How could he possibly be qualified at one location but
          not another when the contract clearly stated that it was not
          based on ancillary services?                      
            Marty’s story is not atypical. Several years ago I was a
          consultant for a large hospital. Needless to say, the hospital
          employees I consulted with had considerably less experience
          and credentials than I. Nonetheless, some of the same insur-
          ance companies and managed care programs that paid the
          hospital handsomely for outpatient services rejected me as
          a private practice provider. The moral of the story is that
          large agencies and influential hospitals often land up on
          provider panels that will reject you or your agency as a
          provider.                                         
            One managed care organization had rejected me on
          numerous occasions with the excuse that there were “too
          many providers in my zip code.” I was repeatedly told that
          if someone dropped out they would let me know so I could
          fill the slot. One day the therapist in the office next door to
          me, who told me she had “connections to get in,” as she put
          it, dropped out of the program. I immediately (say 30 sec-
          onds later) picked up the phone and called to get placed on
          their panel. When they gave me the song and dance routine
          about “too many therapists in my zip code,” I told the gen-
          tleman I overheard my colleague calling him to drop out just
          seconds prior to my call. After stumbling over his words,
          the fellow suggested that perhaps they had miscalculated the
          numbers of helpers in the zip code and he promised to get
          back to me. Well I’m glad I didn’t hold my breath because
          that was about two years ago and I still have never received
          a phone call.                                     
            Managed care — like salaries — is often about as fair
          as playing poker with a card shark who plays with a stacked
          deck.

            As a provider on a new panel, Linda Lewis was pleased
          when she immediately received a referral. Her new client,
          Debra, was 14 years old and highly disturbed. Since Linda’s
          contract stipulated that she could only see the client two
          times she called the managed care company.        
            “There’s nothing to worry about, Ms. Lewis,” the woman
          on the other end of the line assured her. “If you read the fine
          print in your contract you’ll discover that you can request
          six additional sessions for Debra if you need them.”
            “But what if perchance I can’t cure her in eight sessions?”
          Linda protested. “Debra really has some severe problems.”
            After a brief moment of silence, the woman responded.
          “Look I shouldn’t tell you this but we track everybody on a
          computer. And well … if you take over eight sessions you’ll
          never receive another referral from us.”

          Before You See Your First Client                  
            Linda proceeded to treat the young lady in an appropriate
          fashion using more than eight sessions and she has never
          received another referral from the company.       
            Here are some things managed care can dictate and the
          concomitant responses you might hear from them in regard
          to these issues:                                  
             • Who can you see. “The client must see somebody on
               our panel.”                                  
             • How many visits are acceptable. “Your client is eli-
               gible for six more sessions.”                
             • When the visits must occur and how much you can
               charge. “The six visits must take place between July
               9 and October 11 and you can only see the client once
               per week. M.S.W.’s receive $65 for a 50-minute ses-
               sion.” Never mind the fact that your customary charge
               for this service is $80. The managed care firm — not

             • What service is appropriate. “You can use psycho-
               therapy, but not biofeedback.”               
            Many providers in this field consider managed care the
          enemy, yet it does have a positive side. First and foremost,
          managed care companies hire a large number of counselors
          and therapists. In addition, prior to the era of managed care,
          clients often stayed in treatment for lengthy periods of time
          that were unwarranted to say the least. Other clients received
          treatment modalities not considered ideal, since the counse-
          lor was not accountable for his or her actions. Most of the
          practitioners I have spoken with admit such blatant abuse of
          the system ran insurance costs up and was not the best thing
          for the patient. These same practitioners usually agree, nev-
          ertheless, that managed care’s current policies such as
          extremely short hospital stays, and its over-emphasis on

         brevity in terms of outpatient treatment, has gone too far in
         the opposite direction.                            
            Perhaps what we need is a system that espouses a bal-
         anced middle-of-the-road philosophy.

                        a Wider  Range  of People           
                                  than You  Think           
            My past experience as a supervisor of child abuse and
          neglect workers taught me an important lesson about diver-
          sity. I would routinely get calls from African-American cli-
          ents who wanted white workers. When I asked why, the
          answer I usually received was the African-American workers
          were usually “too hard on their own people.” Interestingly
          enough, I would also routinely receive calls from Caucasian
          clients who would vehemently insist that they wanted an
          African-American worker. When asked, they explained it
          was because “African-American workers do more for their
          clients.”                                         
            Were these glittering generalities about Caucasian and
          African-American workers really true? Sometimes perhaps,
          though certainly not in every case. The point nevertheless is

          that you shouldn’t assume that Native Americans, Asian
          Americans, or anyone else automatically wants a helper with
          a similar racial or ethnic background. Clients sometimes
          intentionally request someone who is different. Although
          this won’t be true in every case it behooves us to learn more
          about diversity and cajoles us to face clients from other
          cultures with an optimistic attitude. You can work with a
          wider range of people than you think.

                                            Form            
            I often tell my students that release-of-information forms
          are a helper’s best friend. You should always have a supply
          of them on hand. If you do field work, carry a supply in
          your car, purse, or brief case.                   
            When someone asks you for information concerning a
          client, or anytime you wish to receive feedback regarding a
          client from a source other than the client, you will need a
          release-of-information form signed by the client. 
            In fact, you will often need several of them for a single
          client. Say your client saw a therapist before seeing you.
          You might wish to secure that therapist’s records or talk with
          that particular therapist by phone. A release is required.

          Before You See Your First Client                  
          Perhaps the same client’s attorney calls you and your client
          wants you to talk with her. Again, a release is necessary.
          Perhaps your client is taking medications prescribed by a
          psychiatrist and you want to confer with him to coordinate
          the treatment. You will need the client’s signature and a
          separate release form for each of the three situations.
            Never photocopy the signature and check the dates on
          such forms. Release-of-information forms will generally
          only be applicable for a given period of time.    
            Another hint is that when somebody requests information
          from you (by sending you a signed release-of-information
          form, of course), you should only release information and
          data collected by you and/or your agency. For example, as
          a counselor perhaps you acquired medical information on
          your client from his chiropractor. You could not release this
          to a party requesting information on your client. If the party
          requesting the information insisted that he needed the chi-
          ropractic assessment (which might well be legitimate), then
          your client would have to sign a release for the party in
          question to send it directly to the chiropractor. If you or your
          agency didn’t collect the information first hand, you are not
          permitted to give it to anyone else.

            When I asked 16-year-old Matthew Briggs why he cursed
          out his math teacher and tossed a rock into the school trophy
          closet, he said, “Oh, heck. That’s easy. I’m ADHD (Attention
          Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) and my psychiatrist told me
          I’ve got a chemical imbalance that causes depression.” Mat-
          thew had the psycho-babble lingo down pat.        
            Many counselors and therapists often worry about the
          effects of labeling a client and they darn well should. Some
          clients — like Matthew — use the label as an excuse for
          acting in a dysfunctional manner. In some cases the diagno-
          sis or label simply becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. The
          worst scenario is the so-called iatrogenic illness, a term
          borrowed from medicine to describe a physician-induced
          illness. Thus, when a helper erroneously tells a client that
          he or she has a given illness and the client believes he or

          she suffers from it, then an iatrogenic illness has been
          instilled.                                        
            However, if you are looking to get paid for your services,
          third-party payers such as insurance companies, managed
          care firms, Medicare and Medicaid require a diagnosis from
          the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of the Amer-
          ican Psychiatric Association or the International Classifica-
          tion of Disease (ICD) produced by the World Health Orga-
          nization.                                         
            Many therapists who are aware of the danger of differ-
          ential diagnosis try to straddle the therapeutic fence by giv-
          ing the client an innocuous diagnosis such as “Adjustment
          Disorder.” Unfortunately, some third-party payers will not
          accept diagnoses such as this that are not serious. In other
          cases, third-party payers will not allow the helper to refer
          the client for hospitalization in an emergency without a
          “more disturbed” condition. Translation: Change the diag-
          nosis and they’ll give you what you want!         
            In a computerized global economy, where a diagnosis
          could indeed follow a client around like a dark cloud, a
          helper who despises differential diagnosis will find himself
          or herself in a dilemma.

            A recent newspaper article reported the story of a social
          worker who spent the night in jail. She didn't pull off a bank
          job nor did she hold up an armored car. Instead she put
          somebody else's name as the provider on the insurance bill
          she gave to the client because the insurance carrier in her
          state would not reimburse a social worker's services.
            The person who actually performs the therapeutic service
          must put his or her name on the insurance bill given to the
          client and/or the third party such as an insurance company.
          You may not get paid as often, but I can assure you, you'll
          sleep a lot better!

            Try this creative visualization exercise. You’ve just given
          the best lecture of your professional career to a audience of
          several hundred people, many who could benefit from your
          treatment services. You are convinced your business is ready
          to boom. You even contemplate moving to a larger office in
          order to accommodate all the new clients you’ll be serving.
            Giving presentations is wonderful publicity for your
          agency and/or your practice. You will be informing as well
          as helping others. Lecturing helps to curb pernicious burnout
          and increases the size of your practice.          
            Do not, however, rush out to purchase an SRO (Standing
          Room Only) sign for your office. Here’s why:      
            Typically after administering an effective presentation —
          especially to a large audience — you will have a sizable
          number of individuals who will want to use your services

          or make referrals. The most common scenario, nevertheless,
          is that the referrals from your public appearance will spo-
          radically trickle in. You could receive two referrals on the
          day after the lecture, none during the next four weeks, then
          perhaps three in the next month. You may even receive an
          occasional referral years after your talk. I know I have.
            The referral pattern following a lecture generally resem-
          bles water dripping from a leaky faucet rather than a dam
          that has burst. There will even be times when the phone
          never rings after your self-proclaimed award-winning per-
          formance.                                         
            If you do give a presentation and find your appointment
          book exploding at the seams, then consider yourself fortu-
          nate, but your experience is the exception rather than the
          rule.

            Jerry was the top referral source for the local crisis center.
          In a single month 51 clients were referred to Jerry’s conve-
          niently located private practice. However, by the end of the
          month Jerry only received two inquiries regarding his coun-
          seling service. One of the individuals made an appointment
          and never returned for a second session.          
            Jerry was baffled. With over 50 bona fide referrals in less
          than 30 days he expected his practice to grow quickly. In
          order to put his dilemma in perspective he called his
          long-time friend Pat who had been the center’s top referral
          source some years ago. Pat chuckled and informed Jerry that
          his track record had been even more dismal. Out of 54
          referrals he received during his final month as a provider,

          only one client telephoned to inquire about services and she
          never made an appointment.                        
            To be sure, some referral sources have clients, such as
          those mandated by law, who follow through better than
          others.                                           
            The old business philosophy that suggests a transaction
          isn’t complete until the check clears the bank or you have
          the money in your hand is also true in mental health. A good
          rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t count your referrals until
          you have a warm body in front of you asking for assistance.

                         Psychotherapy   Theories           
            In graduate school, I was taught to pick an intervention
          theory I had faith in and felt comfortable using. It seemed
          like good advice — until I began working with managed
          care and had to make a living.                    
            You see, when you fill out an application to become a
          managed care provider one of the questions you will be
          asked is what treatment modality you use. I can promise you
          that 99.9 percent of the time if you put something like
          person-centered, nondirective, Rogerian, psychodynamic,
          existential, or psychoanalytic your chances of being
          accepted as a provider are almost nil.            
            Managed care programs are typically based on the prin-
          ciple of cost containment. Translated this means brief, stra-

          Before You See Your First Client                  
          tegic, and short-term therapy. When you keep the therapy
          short the managed care firm shells out less money. Therapies
          that encourage you to build an extensive relationship with
          the client such as person-centered counseling, or those that
          espouse delving into one’s past and/or digging up repressed
          memories, do not lend themselves to a maximum of six or
          eight treatment sessions. Such paradigms often assume that
          the client will be coming for months or perhaps even years.
            Many applications directly ask what percentage of clients
          you usually successfully treat in a given number of sessions.
          For example, what percentage of clients do you terminate
          in six sessions or less? Ten sessions or less?    
            Unfortunately when a client is rushed through treatment
          he or she often returns again and again for assistance. In
          reality, much to the chagrin of the managed care firms, it
          might actually take less sessions and cost less money to take
          the time necessary to treat the client once and treat him
          properly.                                         
            Nevertheless, the rule for getting on managed care panels
          at this point in time is really quite simple. Keep your appli-
          cation brief!

            I don’t need to possess a crystal ball or be a mind reader
          to guess what most nonmedical practitioners are thinking
          about this suggestion. “No way. I’m not referring my client
          to a psychiatrist or a medical doctor. They are just pill
          pushers. They’ll just fill my client up with Prozac, Zoloft,
          Paxil, or the drug of the month. That’s what they do with
          every client. They don’t know anything about counseling.”
            Perhaps medical mental-health providers are prescription
          pushers. Nevertheless, imagine how you would feel if your
          client did indeed have a physical problem. Your client could
          be the victim of blood sugar fluctuations, low thyroid, or an
          organic neurological difficulty. If you don’t fancy the idea
          of a law suit and want to rule out an organic problem that
          could abate depression, find a medical practitioner you trust
          and make the referral.

            Laura Swanson had a strange look on her face as we
          perused the test summary pertaining to her youngest son
          Mike. She looked so perplexed I finally inquired about her
          nonverbal messages.                               
            “It’s just so eerie,” remarked Mrs. Swanson. “I guess it
          must be genetics.” Mrs. Swanson was referring to the fact
          that two years before when I sent her oldest son Joey for
          testing the results seemed almost identical.      
            Since I had seen literally hundreds of clients I couldn’t
          remember the exact results of Joey’s psychological workup.
          I waited until the end of our session to pull his file. Much
          to my chagrin Joey’s psychological report wasn’t similar to

          Before You See Your First Client                  
          Mike’s, it was identical except for the first paragraph. After
          my initial shock, I contacted the psychologist who did the
          testing to find out exactly how this could have happened.
            The psychologist explained that the battery of tests was
          indeed administered to each client and the scores tabulated
          but, with the advent of computer word-processing programs,
          reports were no longer truly individualized.      
            Since writing the test reports is a lengthy and arduous
          process only the first paragraph, that is to say, the one that
          talks about the client’s age, appearance, reason for referral,
          and effort put into the administered tests, is 100 percent
          tailored to the actual client in question. The rest of the
          paragraphs are selected from a number of choices written
          prior to the testing and designed to “kind of, sort of, fit any
          client,” as the psychologist put it. For the second, third,
          fourth paragraphs, and so on, the psychologist will pick
          between 12 to 15 paragraph choices based on test results.
          Thus it would not be unusual after a while to have several
          clients with one or more identical paragraphs; or in the case
          of Mike and Joey, two completely identical psychological
          reports.                                          
            When I protested that the procedure was dehumanizing
          and not individualized, the psychologist noted that with the
          computerized method a psychometrician could work a lot
          less, complete numerous reports in a short period of time,
          help more clients and make a greater sum of money.
            I began referring my testing to another individual only
          to discover that she was using the same computerized
          write-ups. I’ve also spoken with a couple of school psycho-
          logical examiners in elementary and secondary schools who
          also use this questionable procedure.             
            Not everyone who administers tests uses this paradigm
          to complete the reports. Nevertheless, if you don’t have the
          time or the expertise to do your own testing and don’t feel
          comfortable with the pick-a-paragraph system of psych

         work-ups, I suggest you talk to the person who does your
         testing about this issue or find another individual who does
         not engage in this practice.*                      
         * Let me emphasize that my commentary in this section refers to a written test
         battery, i.e., summarizing of a number of tests. Many popular tests now offer
         computerized scoring and/or test summaries of a client’s performance on a single
         measure and this practice is ethical in every respect.

            “Look, I’ve just got to tell you this, Dr. Norton. You’re
          a genius. No, I really mean that. Look, I’ve been to seven
          other therapists — and rather good ones I must add. Dr.
          Gleason, of course, studied with Rogers when he was alive,
          and Dr. Kent spent a great deal of time out in California
          with Perls. But the amazing thing is that I’ve made more
          progress in two sessions with you than I made with all of
          them put together. I can’t believe nobody else ever used a
          behavioristic approach. What can I say? You’re wonderful.
          I feel like I wasted the last 12 years of my life going from
          one inept therapist to the next. I don’t know what I would
          have done if I hadn’t met you.”                   
            There is a small chance that this client truly feels that
          Dr. Norton is a therapeutic genius as well as his psychother-
          apeutic savior. There is also a greater chance, however, that

          Before You See Your First Client                  
          this client is playing what I like to call the Pedestal Game.
          Here is how the game works.                       
            The game begins with a client who has a sack full of
          problems and is looking for a knight in shining therapeutic
          armor. During the initial interview this type of client will
          systematically lambaste all his or her previous therapists.
          You’ll hear tip-off comments such as:             
             • “All my ex-therapist ever did was talk about her own
               problems.”                                   
             • “My previous therapist never really gave me any ad-
               vice. I’m not sure what he did to help me.”  
             • “I went for years and never accomplished anything.”
            Then the client — as in the case of Dr. Norton — will
          shower you with praise and of course place you on a pedestal
          well above any of the incompetent helpers in the past. The
          sad part of the game, however, is that in a short period of
          time you can — and probably will — join the ranks of the
          incompetent crowd. In fact, in a short period of time your
          client could be seeing another therapist and lavishing him
          or her with praise using the same lines you heard during the
          initial session.                                  
            Hence, a word to the wise. Don’t pat yourself on the back
          until you’re certain you won’t fall from your pedestal.

            You’ve seen the ads in the professional newspapers and
          newsletter promising increased professionalism and added
          certification letters following your name. It seems with each
          new issue in the professional publications another certifica-
          tion is being offered. Ideally, you would probably like to be
          a member of all of them but time, money, and credentials
          will no doubt dictate the ones you chose to secure.
            When I speak with neophyte counselors I often hear that
          the primary reason they are trying to snare a certificate is to
          enhance their ability to secure third-party and insurance
          payments. My advice is to save your time, money, and ink
          to fill out the generally lengthy application. In 20 years of
          private practice I have never received a single dime of
          income based on an acquired certification. Insurance com-

          panies are interested in state licenses — counseling, psy-
          chology, or social work — period.                 
            I have heard that this could change in the coming years,
          initially in the area of substance abuse counseling.
            Snaring a certification may increase your knowledge,
          professionalism, status in the eyes of your clients, and net-
          working abilities, but it won’t do one iota for your bank
          account. As for the future? I personally hope this chapter
          becomes obsolete in the near future.

                          and  Homicidal   Clients          
            You’ve probably seen it many times at the movies and
          on television. There’s a distraught man standing on the
          twenty-seventh story of the highest building in the city. He’s
          familiar since you’ve seen individuals like him grace the
          silver screen in the past. He’s depressed — so depressed he
          can’t imagine going on with his life. Below, a crowd of
          bystanders gathers, their eyes glued on him. The police chief
          bellows through his megaphone as he tries to dissuade this
          poor soul from ending his life. The place is swarming with
          the SWAT team and hostage negotiation squad.      
            Then the action begins. The hero (usually an irate
          rule-breaking police officer or private detective) swaggers
          out on the ledge. Our suicidal fellow whose life is on the
          line is shocked. Who is this guy and what’s he doing out on
          the ledge with him? Is he crazy or what? Next instead of

          talking this poor soul out of it he offers to push him, jump
          with him, or hand him a weapon so he can put himself out
          of his misery. The suicidal individual is so taken aback he
          decides not to jump after all. The crowd is ecstatic, except
          for the police chief who warns the hero never to do that
          again.                                            
            Now that we’ve covered the tinsel-town version, let’s
          analyze what would occur in a real-life situation if you urged
          a suicidal person to “go ahead and do it” perhaps in the
          confines of an individual counseling session. Chances are
          the depressed fellow would jump, shoot himself, or kill both
          of you! Moreover, if he survived the attempt or successfully
          killed himself and the family found out how you handled
          the case, the chances are good — no make that excellent —
          that you would be in store for the malpractice suit of your
          life.                                             
            Does paradox work? You bet it does and it often works
          extremely well as a therapeutic ploy. A client who is too
          nervous to give a speech in front of his college class is told
          in therapy that he should purposely shake as much as he can
          and try to make a fool of himself. The result will often be
          that he is calm and steady. Paradox is an excellent technique.
          Nevertheless when a life is on the line and you’re dealing
          with a suicidal, homicidal, or suicidal/homicidal client the
          person’s will to live and judgment are waning. In such cases
          the rule of thumb is simple: Avoid paradoxical interventions
          and reverse psychology like the plague.

            Don was taken aback when his supervisor questioned
          him about asking his client if she was suicidal. “Of course
          not,” replied Don, “I don’t want to put the idea in her head.
          Besides, she came to learn behavior modification strategies
          to help her give up smoking.”                     
            Don has decidedly taken the wrong action. A good rule
          of thumb is to ask every client if he or she is suicidal
          regardless of their presenting complaint. To this day, I am
          still surprised by the sheer number of clients who forthrightly
          say “yes” to this question. A high percentage of such clients
          come to the therapy room with innocuous complaints such
          as weight loss, smoking, or lack of assertiveness.
            Generally, suicide is the eighth leading killer of all Amer-
          icans and the second or third leading killer of teens and
          college students. It is estimated that one in 10 individuals

          Before You See Your First Client                  
          will make a suicide attempt before age 19. The geriatric
          suicide rate is more than double what it is for the nation as
          a whole.                                          
            A simple, yet effective five-step plan for dealing with
          suicidal behavior is:                             
             • Ask every client if he or she is suicidal. It won’t put
               the idea in their head.                      
             • If the client has a plan, try to circumvent it. You could,
               for example, have a family member remove pills or
               a firearm. (Just for the record, 65 percent of all sui-
               cides — more than all the other methods put together
               — involve guns or rifles.)                   
             • Contract with the person to stay alive. (If the individ-
               ual will not sign a behavioral contract or agree to a
               verbal contract then refer the client to a hospital set-
               ting.)                                       
             • Rule out organic factors by referring the client to a
               psychiatrist or other medical doctor.        
             • Make certain that the client continues to receive psy-
               chotherapy.

            I will never forget the excitement I felt after I read the
          book Uncommon Therapy which depicted the therapeutic
          genius of Milton H. Erickson. I wanted to be Erickson for
          my clients. After all, they deserved the best and most effi-
          cacious treatment — a Milton H. Erickson clone if you will.
            I picked a client in my caseload who seemed similar to
          one Erickson had treated in his book: an eighth-grade male
          who seemed to be responding quite well to a Rogerian
          approach. Nevertheless, I anticipated that his treatment
          program would be even more efficacious after I began
          implementing an Ericksonian intervention. I memorized
          Erickson’s verbiage for my client’s next session. Just to
          make certain I didn’t miss a beat I placed a copy of Erick-
          son’s interventions behind my desk so I could refer to it if
          necessary.

          Before You See Your First Client                  
            One of the youngster’s teachers had heard positive things
          about my work and accompanied my client to the session.
          The teacher felt she had information that could be clinically
          significant and she wanted to use my services for other
          youngsters with emotional difficulties.           
            Since Erickson was extremely forceful with his client
          (actually, belligerent might be putting it more accurately), I
          decided to do the same. Unfortunately, as I started to read
          my Ericksonian script my client did not respond in a positive
          manner. Instead, he ran out of my office crying and he never
          returned. His teacher said she was appalled by my therapeu-
          tic tactlessness and informed me that she would never refer
          anybody to me.                                    
            Lest the reader assume that I was cured of my Milton H.
          Erickson clone fascination, I must admit I was not. I was
          convinced that my client’s reaction had been a fluke, and
          that nearly any other client would have responded in a pos-
          itive manner. Several months later I used a verbatim tran-
          script of one of Erickson’s hypnotic dialogues with a client
          I was seeing for stress reduction. The client noticed that I
          was using a new technique and stated toward the end of the
          session that although the new procedure was somewhat help-
          ful, he wholeheartedly favored my traditional approach as
          better.                                           
            Looking back on my Ericksonian clone experiments I
          now see my mistakes. First, no two clients are the same.
          Although I thought my clients were similar to Erickson’s
          they were certainly not identical. And secondly, my person-
          ality and personal attributes are different than his. In fact I
          am convinced that if Erickson had actually been seeing my
          clients he would never have chosen the techniques or hyp-
          notic inductions that I inappropriately implemented. The
          essence of his genius was precisely that he worked with each
          client as an individual.

                          When   In Doubt,  Use a           
                      Person-Centered   Response            
            If you’re a golfer you’ve no doubt heard the old saying
          that asserts, “When in doubt, use a five iron.” That is not
          bad advice. For those of you who don’t hit the little old
          white ball around let me explain this gem of wisdom. A five
          iron does not hit the ball a long distance like some other
          clubs. Neither does it have the accuracy of other clubs to hit
          the ball a short distance. Basically, a five iron is a mid-
          dle-of-the-road club — in between everything else. It has a
          fair degree of accuracy and allows you to hit the ball a fair
          amount of distance. Because of this, golfers who are unsure
          what club to use are often told to rely on the trusty five iron.
          No, it won’t give you spectacular distance like a long iron
          or a wood or a pinpoint bull’s-eye accuracy like a short iron,
          but on the other hand it won’t do anything too extreme to
          damage your score.

          Before You See Your First Client                  
            Therapy is a lot like golf. There are many times when
          even the best therapist is sitting there with no idea — I mean
          absolutely none — how to respond to the person or persons
          in the session. Sure you could rely on silence and a few
          “uh-hums,” but a strict reliance on such responses can be
          frustrating for many clients.                     
            Over the years (after making literally hundreds, maybe
          thousands, of therapeutic blunders) I learned that Per-
          son-Centered Rogerian Therapy is a lot like pulling out your
          trusty old five iron. In other words, it’s a safe bet. A per-
          son-centered response generally won’t produce bells, whis-
          tles, magical cures, or insights that take your breath away.
          But, like a five iron, it won’t cause any damage either. You
          won’t, for example, usually see a client bolting out of the
          office as was the case in my aforementioned Ericksonian
          clone experiment.                                 
            One day I was talking to a highly trained clinical psy-
          chologist who had a practice next door to mine about this
          principle and told him that I was a bit perplexed that this
          advice never seemed to be forthcoming at seminars and
          workshops in the field. My colleague merely shrugged his
          shoulders and replied, “That’s easy. Good therapy is slow,
          rarely dramatic, and often boring. Nobody wants to pay to
          see that at a workshop.” And so it goes.          
            The next time you’re in a therapeutic bind forget about
          confrontation, a wild clinical hunch, or a bogus Freudian
          interpretation. Your therapeutic person-centered five iron —
          composed primarily of paraphrasing and reflection — will
          go the distance toward helping your client.

                                  as Hug  a Client          
            The late 1960s and early ’70s was an era characterized
          by the “summer-of-love,” bell-bottom pants, long hair, and
          the philosophy espousing you to “do your own things as
          long as it doesn’t hurt anyone else.” Then there was psycho-
          therapy — encounter groups, rolfing, physically stroking
          clients, and hand massages. Any therapist worth his or her
          salt gave each and every client a fatherly or motherly hug.
          And why not? The human touch was and still is comforting.
          Some research even indicates that it is physiologically ben-
          eficial.                                          
            I’ll never forget a graduate internship I served with a
          professor in his private practice. It was my first day and my
          professor ran up to a female and gave her a hug so powerful
          he nearly lifted her off the ground. As the woman walked
          into the therapy room I asked my professor in a whisper

          Before You See Your First Client                  
          whether the woman was his wife or his sister. He looked at
          me like I had experienced a psychotic break from reality and
          said, “Howard, that’s our four o’clock client. This will be
          our first co-therapy session together.”           
            I have an interesting audio tape recorded in the 1970s
          from a local college library that I often play for my students.
          On the tape an experienced male therapist states that he does
          not believe in sexual contact with female clients. The female
          therapists on the tape actually argue with him and express
          their viewpoint that displaying sexual behavior toward
          female clients could be beneficial.               
            But times change and it seems the pendulum has swung
          to the opposite end of the therapeutic spectrum. I routinely
          ask my students and those I supervise or consult whether
          hugging a client is ethical. The answer I usually get is
          something like, “Get serious. Of course, it’s ethical and it’s
          therapeutic for my clients. It’s not like I’m having sex with
          them or anything.”                                
            In the state where I live and work, hugging is considered
          an ethical violation just like having sex with a client. When
          I first came across this fact in the ethical guidelines, I called
          my licensing bureau to see if clients had filed misconduct
          charges against counselors for hugging. The director of
          licensing said that clients had contacted the licensing bureau
          to complain about such behavior.                  
            When I explain that such behavior is deemed unethical
          the response is often, “Show me. I don’t believe it!”
            This “show me” attitude is precisely my point. Practi-
          tioners should read the ethical guidelines set forth by their
          state licensing board or professional organization.
            Moreover, if you take a close look at your malpractice
          insurance I can almost assure you it has a stipulation that if
          somebody files a sexual claim against you it will either be

         paid at a lesser rate than normal or your insurance carrier
         will not back you at all.                          
            So although bell-bottom pants and sixties platform shoes
         are making a comeback, the same cannot be said for touchy,
         feelie, huggy therapeutic interventions.

            It was Brett Park’s first day as my supervisee and it was
          quite evident he was trying to impress me with his thera-
          peutic judgment and his clinical savvy. As Amy, a 
          32-year-old teary-eyed female in our hospital group talked
          about her tendency to feel trapped, Brett glanced at me and
          lifted his eyelids as if to say, “I know exactly what’s troubling
          her, watch me put her out of her misery.” With his
          holier-than-thou mentality, he abruptly interrupted her.
            “Amy, Amy. Stop. What I want to know is why are you
          staying in a relationship with a man who physically abuses
          you? Why don’t you get out?”                      
            Amy as well as the other members of the therapy group
          looked spell-bound. “What?”                       
            Again Brett checked eyes with me to make certain I was
          witnessing his city-on-a-hill interpretation of the century.

          “Amy I repeat, why are you staying in a relationship with a
          man who is abusive?”                              
            I knew what was coming but I figured Brett needed to
          learn a lesson and he’d find out soon enough anyway.
            “Brett,” she said sheepishly, “I’m not in a relationship
          with a man, I’m a lesbian.”                       
            Think back to when you were a teenager and you were
          trying to act really cool and impress somebody. Most likely
          you did appear really cool until you did something stupid
          like spilling a soda on your date or walking face first into a
          closed door.                                      
            Brett later admitted that he felt foolish for not waiting to
          secure all the facts, not to mention the fact that he obviously
          hadn’t read the client’s hospital chart. The worse part was
          that Amy told me privately that she immediately lost faith
          in him as a therapist because he seemed to be analyzing her
          situation before he knew anything about her.      
            Don’t try to be a guru or a palm reader because I can
          almost assure you that sooner or later you’ll end up with a
          face full of tea leaves! Listen to the client and by all means
          resist the temptation to rush to judgment. You’ll be a much
          better helper and you’ll avoid a slew of bumps on your
          forehead.

            I have to chuckle when I hear new students talking about
          what makes a counselor an effective helper. The following
          statement is a generic version of something I frequently hear.
            “Man, I’ll tell you that therapist is a lot better than all
          the rest. I mean he got right up in that guy’s face and chopped
          him down to size with a few well-chosen curse words. It
          was fabulous. The therapist was yelling so loudly you could
          hear him in the next suite of offices.”           
            Not only is this style of combat intervention not good
          therapy — it probably isn’t therapy at all. Helping isn’t about
          “chopping the client down to size.” Most of us know at least
          one spouse, son, daughter, boss, teacher, or mother-in-law
          who can do that quite effectively.

            A landmark movie loosely dubbed the Gloria Film (the
          actual name is Three Approaches to Psychotherapy) is illus-
          trative of this fact. Gloria, the client, is given a brief psy-
          chotherapy session with the three greatest living therapists
          at that time: Carl R. Rogers, Albert Ellis, and Fritz Perls.
          Rogers was kind and empathic to Gloria. Ellis came across
          somewhat didactic and intellectual. Perls on the other hand
          was sarcastic, overly confrontive, and quite belligerent. Dur-
          ing the first few minutes of the interview he forthrightly
          called Gloria a phony for smiling when she purported that
          she was nervous. When she was interviewed after the movie,
          Gloria asserted that overall she liked Perls the best. Years
          later, however, she reflected on the experience and stated
          that Perl’s intervention was psychologically damaging and
          had a profound negative impact on her.            
            Please don’t misunderstand me. It is certainly appropriate
          to confront your clients. However, I would suggest to you
          that in terms of confrontation, timing is everything. A con-
          frontation that would be inappropriate during your initial
          meeting with the client could be right on target during per-
          haps the eighth or tenth therapy session. When I took back
          I am convinced that the number one factor that produced
          disastrous outcomes resulted from confronting clients too
          quickly and with too little tact.                 
            In most cases the rule on confrontation is simple. Later
          is nearly always better than sooner.

            Molly went to the job interview and felt like she just hit
          the ultimate grand slam of her career. The interviewer
          seemed thoroughly impressed with her answers. Molly
          thought her interview went perfectly — perhaps even a little
          too perfectly.                                    
            Two days later Molly was horrified when she received a
          rejection letter in the mail. Molly did what nearly every other
          job applicant would do in a similar situation. She began soul
          searching in an attempt to discover what she did wrong or
          what qualities she lacked. Perhaps she needed another course
          in group work? Maybe her answers were shallow regarding
          interventions with resistant clients. Perhaps she should have
          worn her gray pants suit instead of her dark blue one to the
          interview. In essence, she was certain that she did something

          wrong. She whipped out her mental baseball bat and emo-
          tionally beat herself to a pulp.                  
            What the Mollies of this world usually don’t stop to think
          about is that agencies often promote from within, and that
          she never had a chance at the job. Nevertheless, to keep
          things ethical and honest, many agencies, hospitals, and
          practices run ads for the job in the newspaper, send copies
          of the job description to college and university job bulletin
          boards, and apprise the state employment security office of
          the opening.                                      
            How will you know if the job will be filled from within?
          You won’t. But you should still do your best in the interview
          because (a) there might truly be a job opening, (b) the person
          they have slated for the job could leave unexpectedly and
          they will need an outsider to fill the position, and (c) they
          may decide they really like you and have another position
          for you.                                          
            Do the best you can on each and every job interview.
          Just remember that if things go a little too smoothly, the
          interviewer may secretly have somebody else groomed for
          the position. Thus don’t blame yourself and feel free to wear
          the same color pants suit or slacks to your next interview.

            As a caseworker, I routinely interviewed my clients in
          their homes, but Mr. Burton requested a session at our office.
          Over the phone he sounded as if he was at the end of his
          rope and I acquiesced to his request for an office visit. He
          was crying crocodile tears as he told me about the abuse his
          wife was inflicting upon him. I was highly empathic and my
          heart went out to this man as he recounted tales of physical
          abuse. Quite frankly, I was beyond the point of empathy. I
          felt sympathy for my client.                      
            My diagnosis was simple. He was a battered husband
          and in a period of psychotherapy when behavior therapy was
          king, I decided that the only sensible treatment of choice for
          this man was assertiveness training. I couldn’t wait for my
          morning meeting to share my thoughts with my supervisor.

          I was certain she would approve my plan of action so I could
          turn this man into an assertive individual who could finally
          stand up to his wife.                             
            During my supervisory session I recounted the specifics
          of my meeting with Mr. Burton. My supervisor listened
          intently and it was obvious that she was hanging onto every
          word. Finally she spoke.                          
            “Howard,” she said, “listen to me. This man is dangerous,
          very dangerous. And I have no doubt that he could hurt or
          perhaps even kill his wife and children. You need to advise
          Mrs. Burton to get out now. Do you understand me?”
            Did I understand her? Quite honestly I thought she was
          nuts. I had just explained how this man was the victim and
          my supervisor had the audacity to suggest he could be a
          perpetrator and a batterer. I was bewildered. Where in the
          world was my supervisor coming from? Perhaps she needed
          a little psychological help herself!              
            My best friend, who was also a brand new caseworker
          at the time, wholeheartedly agreed that Mr. Burton needed
          assertiveness training. Over a hamburger, fries, and a shake
          at lunch we both came to the conclusion that my supervisor
          was incompetent despite her vast experience. Her directives
          provided us with a great belly laugh.             
            When I returned from lunch I had a message to call the
          FBI. It seems that Mr. Burton had beat up his wife, took the
          kids over the state line, and was holding them at gun point
          with his old M-16 army rifle! The FBI was calling me for
          a personality profile. What in the world was I going to say?
          “Oh, gee, I just think the guy needs to learn a little asser-
          tiveness training so he can stand up for himself.”
            I guess I don’t even have to mention that I felt even more
          inept when I visited Mrs. Burton at her home and discovered
          that her husband broke three of her ribs before he took off
          with the kids.

            I learned two important lessons that day. One, I needed
         to take my supervisor’s vast knowledge and experience seri-
         ously. And, two, maybe when she talked, I needed to listen
         and take her advice.

            I was one of six professionals participating in a fos-
          ter-care permanency planning and review team. We were
          staffing the case of 12-year-old Doris Hollander. Both she
          and her father, Bob Hollander, were present.      
            As we discussed whether Doris should return home, we
          tossed around numerous psychological and social work
          terms. During this hour-and-a-half session the abbreviated
          term “division” was used for the Division of Family Services
          repeatedly.                                       
            Suddenly Mr. Hollander, who had been laconic, stood up
          and began yelling. “The division this, the division that. I’m
          sick of this. We’ve been here for over an hour and that’s all
          you’ve talked about. If we’re not gonna talk about poor little
          Doris, and have to discuss arithmetic, can’t we discuss sub-
          traction, multiplication, or addition? We’ve been talking
          about nothing but division.”

          Before You See Your First Client                  
            A thorough check of the record indicated that Mr. Hol-
          lander was virtually illiterate, uneducated, and mentally
          retarded. He truly had no idea what we were talking about.
            Thus, in Mr. Hollander’s mind, division was a mathemat-
          ical term, rather than an abbreviation.           
            It reminds me of the old story about the hypnotist. He’s
          hypnotizing a patient and thinks he’s doing rather well. Just
          as the hypnotist is convinced that the patient is in a trance
          state, the patient opens his eyes and blurts out: “Hey, Doc,
          by the way, what the heck does cataleptic mean?”  
            When working with clients make sure that you explain
          all the lingo, technical jargon, and/or abbreviations that you
          are using. Two CB radios must be on the same channel to
          effectively communicate. Why would you assume that the
          helper/helpee relationship is any different?

            Sue Spector’s clients have a distinct advantage over the
          other clients in her geographical service area. Sue’s clients,
          who have no place to stay, are allowed to spend six days in
          the local shelter for the homeless. Other helpers’ clients are
          only allowed three days. Her clients routinely seem to get
          better food orders, clothing allowances, and see their work-
          ers at the local mental health clinic faster than clients served
          by others workers.                                
            Sue Spector isn’t smarter or more educated than her
          peers. And she’s not courting an influential politician or
          businessman. She has, nevertheless, mastered the fine art of
          networking.                                       
            Networking has also been beneficial for Wayne Sills. On
          three separate occasions Wayne has been able to land a job

          over night. His colleagues are still lamenting and spending
          the better part of the day searching for job leads.
            Roughly speaking, networking is the act of making
          work-related contacts with others in the field. You can net-
          work by attending conferences, workshops, fund raisers, or
          social service award banquets. You can network by getting
          to know your professors and practicum instructors better. In
          fact, the people who are the most adept at networking are
          those who are sophisticated and creative enough to use the
          technique in almost every situation.              
            It would be impossible to overestimate the power of
          networking for your clients, yourself, your practice, or your
          agency. So often it’s not what you know but who you know
          through networking. Have you done your networking for
          today? If the answer is “no,” then pick up the phone and
          make contact.

                        Grandfathering:  The  Fast          
                       Track for Snaring Licenses           
                                and Certifications          
            In the state where I practice, it might surprise you to learn
          that thousands of social workers don’t even have a bachelor’s
          degree in social work. Some have never even taken a course
          in the field. I know scores of others with Ph.D.’s who have
          been told they cannot even sit for the psychology licensing
          exam, while I know one licensed clinical psychologist who
          has a bachelor’s degree and some graduate work.   
            The whole thing sounds crazy. How could people with
          little or no credentials secure licenses and/or certifications
          while others who are armed to the teeth with knowledge and
          experience have the door slammed in their faces?  
            The answer can be neatly summed up in one term: grand-
          fathering. The term “grandfather clause” refers historically
          to a procedure enacted by some Southern states in which a
          literacy requirement for voters was waived for those whose

=== Page 83 (1 cols) ===
68                             
          Before You See Your First Client                  
          forebearers voted before the Civil War. Today, in the fields
          of mental health and social service, a grandfather clause
          forbids you from practicing a given profession, such as psy-
          chology, and/or using a given title, such as certified addic-
          tion’s counselor, unless you were practicing prior to the
          enactment of the legislation.                     
            What this means in plain everyday English is that when
          a new license or certification is introduced there is usually
          a window period in which practitioners can sneak in with
          credentials that would not be acceptable at a later date.
            Take the social workers mentioned earlier. Currently, in
          the state where I practice, a social worker would need an
          M.S.W. from an accredited school, postgraduate experience,
          and a passing score on the social work exam in order to be
          licensed. During the grandfathering window period, how-
          ever, basically all that was needed was experience in the
          field.                                            
            Every year in my undergraduate Introduction to Human
          Services classes I teach the necessary criteria to enter the
          different professions. Without fail, someone comes to the
          next class and says something like, “Hey, my neighbor is a
          psychologist, counselor, substance abuse specialist, mar-
          riage and family therapist, social worker etc. etc. and she
          doesn’t meet those requirements you’re talking about.”
            Of course, nine out of 10 times the student is correct:
          Her neighbor jumped on the bandwagon immediately and
          was grandfathered in. Hence, the irony is that many, if not
          most of the professionals who were wise enough to take
          advantage of grandfathering, would not be eligible to prac-
          tice based on their current qualifications.       
            So what does this have to do with you? If you see a
          license or certification that you believe could even remotely
          help your career — either now or in the future — then my
          advice is to take action and apply for it immediately. Don’t
          wait. Grandfathering periods are often short and if you blink

         —  or think about it too long — you could miss your golden
         opportunity.                                       
            A word of caution is in order, however. A certificate or
         license obtained via grandfathering is not always equal to a
         certificate or license earned via the procedures required in
         the post-grandfathering stage. Take the social workers I men-
         tioned earlier who are licensed, but do not have M.S.W.
         degrees. Many of them have discovered that insurance com-
         panies and managed care firms (who may indeed be greedy
         but are hardly stupid) are familiar with the grandfathering
         procedure. Thus, social workers in our state who submit
         insurance claims as providers are often told: “Oh, you are a
         Licensed Clinical Social Worker, that’s great. Send us a copy
         of your M.S.W. degree or transcript.” Of course, at that point
         in time, the party is all over. One social worker who grand-
         fathered in without an M.S.W. told me that she has never
         been accepted on a managed care panel nor has she ever
         been reimbursed for performing therapy.            
            Grandfathering did, nonetheless, allow her to legally
         throw up a shingle and offer her own fee for service practice.

            You can be the best service provider or the finest agency
          in the world but if nobody knows about you it will not matter.
          There are two key reasons why this contention is of the
          utmost importance. The first is because nobody can benefit
          from your expertise, and secondly that your agency will soon
          be going out of business.                         
            Many helpers admit they could care less about marketing.
          They often forget the obvious: clients and referral sources
          must be aware of your services in order to use them.
            There was a time — and not that long ago — when 
          professionals outside of the mental health and social service
          arena who marketed themselves or their agencies were the
          exception rather than the rule. Times have changed. Dentists,
          chiropractors, and attorneys routinely spend huge sums of
          money marketing their services. For example, a group of

72                             
          Before You See Your First Client                  
          attorneys in a large metropolitan area told me that one single
          ad on the back cover of the telephone directory costs them
          over $65,000 (gulp) a year. And that doesn’t include the rest
          of their phone bill.                              
            In our field, hospitals and large corporations are taking
          interstate billboard ads, telephone yellow pages space that
          rivals attorneys, and sometimes even television and radio
          spots.                                            
            Unknown to many helpers — even some seasoned pro-
          fessionals — press releases are a way to compete on a small
          scale. Direct-mail marketing experts call press releases “free
          advertising.”                                     
            In case you didn’t know it, anybody can send out a press
          release — you don’t have to be an actor, a multi-billion
          dollar corporation, or a U.S. Senator. Your only investment
          costs are for envelopes, stamps, and the paper they are
          printed on.                                       
            You can send a press release to literally any media: tele-
          vision, radio stations, and periodicals such as magazines,
          journals, professional newsletters, and newspapers are the
          most common sources.                              
            Statistically speaking, most press releases sent out in our
          field come from book publishers and professional organiza-
          tions, however, I must re-emphasize that you can send them
          out on your own to announce anything new, such as an
          upcoming event, new program or service, change of address
          or name, additional personnel, promotions, or even an
          employee of the month.                            
            Perhaps you are starting a relapse day-treatment program
          for cocaine addicts. Maybe your agency created a hotline
          for those who are experiencing panic attacks. Your practice
          could be integrating biofeedback to help athletes combat
          stress. Any or all of these programs could be the subject of
          a press release.

                                       Howard Rosenthal     
            Creating a press release is simple. First, target your
         source and call to find out the person to send your release
         to. If there is a special section of the paper you want your
         release to appear in, you could address the envelope to reflect
         your choice, for example, The Daily Herald News, Mental
         Health Helps Column.                               
            To write a press release you simply begin with the words
         “press release,” the date, and the name and number of the
         contact person at your agency or practice. Then type a
         description of who you are and what you are doing. Short
         press releases that are double-spaced, less than a page, and
         sound newsworthy are most likely to get published. For
         example, several years ago I sent out one that began: Noted
         therapist/author opens a private practice in West County.
         Several of the freebie neighborhood publications in my area
         ran the release as did the largest paid daily newspaper. I
         might add that I’ve had excellent success with professional
         newsletters distributed nationally when I’ve written a new
         book or created a relevant audio program.          
            It is important to know that media sources are not obli-
         gated to publicize your press release. Moreover, the media
         source will not inform you when and if the release is pub-
         lished, therefore it will be up to you to spot it. Lastly, a
         wallet-size black-and-white photo of yourself will some-
         times be used via the media source if you are so inclined to
         send one. Regardless of whether the release runs or not, your
         photo will not be returned to you.

            When Lou began working for the agency he boldly 
          announced that he didn’t believe in reporting cases of child
          abuse to the authorities. “It degrades the relationship I have
          built with the family,” he explained.             
            Unfortunately, Lou wrongly assumes that he has a choice
          in the matter. Professional mental health and social service
          personnel are mandated reporters — they must report to the
          state child abuse hotline all suspected cases of physical
          abuse, neglect, sexual abuse, and exploitation. It’s the law.
            What’s more, all reports must be filed in a timely manner.
          I recently read about a case concerning a counselor who
          discovered on a Friday that a child was being sexually
          abused. The counselor reported it the first thing Monday
          morning. Sadly enough, the child was abused over the week-
          end and legal action was taken against the counselor.

            Turning one’s head on abuse/neglect situations is detri-
          mental to the helper’s welfare, as well as the client’s. A
          school principal once boasted, “We don’t have any abuse in
          my school, if you know what I mean. We don’t need the
          negative publicity in my school district.” Several weeks later
          it was discovered that one of his pupils was being severely
          abused. The news media — the very people he wished to
          avoid — rushed in to find out why he had not been on top
          of the situation and reported the abuse. Thus in an attempt
          to avoid bad publicity, his inaction fostered it and endan-
          gered a child’s life.                             
            Remember: Report each and every suspected case of
          child abuse and neglect. It’s the law.

            There was a time when you could tell your therapist
          anything and it was confidential, but a 1974 landmark pre-
          cedent-setting case changed all that.             
            A client named Prosenjit Poddar went into a college
          counseling center and said he was going to kill his girlfriend,
          Tatiana Tarasoff, when she returned from vacation. The psy-
          chologist at the center believed him and thus sought the
          guidance of his supervisor. The supervisor was also con-
          vinced that the gentleman was serious and contacted the
          campus police. The campus police said that they knew Pod-
          dar and did not consider him a serious threat. Not long after,
          Poddar brutally murdered Tarasoff.

          Before You See Your First Client                  
            Tarasoff’s parents were incensed. They contended they
          could have protected their daughter if she had known she
          was in danger. The parents thus sued the university (Tarasoff
          v. Regents of the University of California) and lost. The
          parents — convinced they had a valid point — appealed the
          case. The decision was overturned by the state supreme
          court. The supreme court ruled that a therapist has a duty to
          warn an intended victim.                          
            Because of the Tarasoff case and subsequent cases that
          reaffirmed this decision, nearly every ethical code for coun-
          selors, psychologists, social workers, and addictions special-
          ists advises helpers to take reasonable action in cases where
          suicide or homicide are evident. Every helper is urged to
          break confidentiality in order to save a life. Check your
          state’s licensing ethics or your professional organization’s
          ethical code regarding this important issue.

            Lisa knew what she wanted to do in life and thus enrolled
          in the local master’s degree program at a private university
          in order to reach her goal. Two years later she received her
          degree in counselor education and was in hot pursuit of her
          dream: A career as a school counselor in an elementary or
          secondary public school.                          
            Much to her chagrin and shock she was told during her
          first job interview that she did not meet the qualifications
          for the position. Worse yet, she was informed that with her
          qualifications she would not be qualified for the position of
          counselor at any public elementary or secondary institution.
            What Lisa was unaware of — and many others like her
          — is that public schools are under the auspices of the state
          department of education.

          Before You See Your First Client                  
            Here is the question I routinely ask my undergraduate
          students who are first entering the field. Could I secure a job
          as a counselor in a public school? I have a doctorate in
          counseling, I’m a licensed professional counselor, and I have
          a number of national certifications.              
            The answer, like Lisa, is that I too am unqualified for
          such a position. The reason is that in the state where I live
          the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education
          requires that school counselors must work as school teachers
          for two years. Although that particular requirement is hardly
          true in every state, it is true that state departments of edu-
          cation set certification standards for positions in public
          schools. Often these standards are totally different than the
          standards that are set for licensed practitioners working in
          public, private, agency, or hospital settings. The courses and
          experiences can be mutually exclusive from those set by the
          Board of Healing Arts, the Department of Economic Regu-
          lation, or any other body that governs licensed healers.
            Looking at it from the other side, a school counselor
          would not necessarily be licensed as a counselor and there-
          fore could not work in private practice. A certified school
          psychologist or school social worker might not be licensed
          to practice outside the public school and the licensed psy-
          chologist or social worker would not necessarily have the
          credentials to work in the public school system.  
            If your goal is to work in a public school, contact the
          department of education in your state as early in your career
          as possible and make certain — unlike poor Lisa — that
          you fulfill their requirements. Private schools and colleges
          are exempt from department of education certification
          requirements, however, there are indeed private schools that
          make such credentials mandatory for employment.   
            A journey of a thousand miles starts with the first step.
          Make certain your first stride is in the right direction!

                        Professional Self-Esteem            
            Bonita was one of the most competent therapists I knew.
          She was well-trained, had a wealth of experience, and she
          was a leader in the area of sexual abuse treatment. As she
          left the courtroom, she appeared somewhat like a soldier
          coming home after being beaten in battle. Tears streamed
          down her cheeks as she told me how incompetent she felt.
          In a fit of sadness, hurt, and anger she said, “I don’t know
          if I will ever practice psychotherapy again. Perhaps that
          attorney was correct, maybe I don’t know what I’m talking
          about.”                                           
            Poor Bonita was responding to the intense verbal beating
          she had sustained just moments earlier in the courtroom. I
          was present and I had to admit it wasn’t a pretty sight.
          Bonita, an M.S.W. social worker, had little training in the
          area of psychological testing. The attorney who opposed her

          Before You See Your First Client                  
          client asked her numerous intricate questions about the pro-
          jective Rorschach Ink Blot Test. Bonita, who had never been
          trained in testing, was unable to answer any of his questions.
          When this happened the attorney merely laughed, shrugged
          his shoulders, rolled his eyes, turned to the judge and sar-
          castically said: “And she calls herself an expert witness. Give
          me a break.”                                      
            Years later, I personally experienced a similar situation.
          I was testifying as an expert witness for an adolescent who
          was seemingly suicidal while living in her father’s home due
          to his tendency to be abusive. The father, who wanted cus-
          tody and desperately wanted to keep the child in his home,
          hired a pit-bull attorney who decided he was going to make
          mince meat out of me that day — which he did.     
            He began by asking me whether I was aware that the
          young lady had been treated for a cavity several days before
          I had interviewed her. I truthfully admitted I was not. He
          then asked me whether I was familiar with an antiquated
          obscure study and he listed the names of the researchers.
          Once again, I was honest and conceded my ignorance. On
          doing so the attorney proclaimed that the study conclusively
          demonstrated that dental work exacerbates depression and,
          needless to say, that affected my assessment of the client.
          He then leaned toward me with an eyeball-to-eyeball stare
          intended to instill a high degree of shame and uttered, “And
          you call yourself an expert witness. Ha!” One thing was for
          certain. Either I was experiencing déjà vu or the attorney
          was wining and dining the lawyer who had gone for Bonita’s
          jugular vein.                                     
            After seeing what happened to Bonita, and experiencing
          it myself, I decided to ask my own attorney how attorneys
          are so adept at lambasting a helper’s professional
          self-esteem, and how helpers can inoculate themselves from
          this legal intimidation.

                                       Howard Rosenthal     
            My attorney suggested that it is generally quite easy to
         lower a professional helper’s credibility. The attorney merely
         looks for a weakness in the witness’ training. In Bonita’s
         case it was simple. Social workers often possess little or no
         training in psychological testing, especially projectives like
         the Rorschach. In my case, the attorney banked on the fact
         that as a nonmedical therapist I had never had a single course
         in dentistry. And … surprise … surprise … he was correct.
         My attorney even suggested that on occasion a lawyer might
         actually contact a therapist who is not involved in the case
         to help him or her choose a little-known therapeutic fact that
         the witness is not cognizant of. Pretty sneaky, huh?
            Anyway, my attorney suggested that the only way to
         inoculate one’s self is to do so psychologically. That is to
         say, you should be eminently prepared for your day in court
         but must realize that the opposing attorney usually can and
         will intimidate you by asking questions that you and most
         likely none of your peers with similar training would have
         a chance of answering.                             
            Make a vow to yourself that you absolutely, positively
         will not allow any attorney to take away your professional
         self-esteem. Say to yourself, I’m okay but I’m not sure about
         that attorney.

                         to Invest in Your Future           
            The state licensing board told Larry they might accept
          his course, Vocational Center Counseling, based on the cat-
          alog description. Since Larry had completed the course in
          1971, and since the school could not find the catalog, Larry
          was fortunate that he had saved an original copy at home.
          Despite the fact that the paper was turning a funny shade of
          yellow, the licensing bureau decided that this old course met
          the requirements for licensing.                   
            There are several reasons to keep your course catalogs.
          The first is that names of courses and course descriptions
          change over the years. In order to justify a course for state
          licensing, certification bodies, or teacher certification, an
          explanation of the course is often required. As a teacher in
          a college I admit that 99 percent of the time your college or
          university will be able to find and copy a page from the
          original catalog. However, I have come across several

86                             
          Before You See Your First Client                  
          instances such as Larry’s, in which the school was unable
          to produce the catalog or the original description. It is rare
          but has been known to occur.                      
            Another reason to keep the original catalog is that pro-
          gram requirements change over the years. If you have an
          original catalog you can prove to the school administration
          that you met the current requirements for graduation when
          you began your course of study. Some — though certainly
          not all colleges, universities, and graduate schools — will
          honor the requirements that were relevant when you began
          the program. Thus, this principle usually applies to part-time
          students or those who had to drop out for a while and
          therefore have been in school for an extended period of time.
            Course catalog descriptions are often worth keeping
          especially if you are transferring to another school and wish
          to sell the new school that your previous course, despite the
          fact that your course had a radically different name, is none-
          theless equivalent to the one they want you to shell out time
          and money to take.                                
            Some schools and licensing/certification bodies won’t
          even accept a course catalog description on the basis that it
          doesn’t give enough information. In order to satisfy these
          tight-fisted folks I recommend you consider the possibility
          of keeping a file filled with your course syllabi and outlines.
          This will allow you to share your readings, topics covered
          in the course, and assignments required.

                                Using  Small Talk           
            Years ago the professor for my group counseling courses
          suggested what seemed like the perfect interactive experi-
          ence for my daily 11 o’clock stress unit hospital group.
          Group members were given a list of 10 individuals, five
          males and five females, with a brief description of each. The
          group then had to agree on five people to take to a new planet
          to start a new civilization. Most of the group participants at
          this particular hospital were factory workers and the male
          clients were a tad chauvinistic to say the least. It didn’t take
          a specialist in group work to see that all the female members
          were literally sitting quietly outside the circle and were not
          participating in the group exercise. It was painfully obvious
          even to the untrained eye.

=== Page 103 (1 cols) ===
88                             
          Before You See Your First Client                  
            The male comments seemed to be reinforcing this con-
          figuration. “We need manpower for the new planet. These
          guys will need to lift heavy rocks and perform intense labor
          as they build new structures.” Another male added, “Of
          course we’ll need someone who is tough to protect us and
          keep everyone safe.” On several occasions the males reluc-
          tantly admitted that a female would have to “come along for
          the ride” — meaning for the purpose of procreation.
            Although the guys loved the exercise exactly as it was
          outlined by my professor, I was convinced that the experi-
          ence had to be tweaked to encourage female participation;
          not to mention the sexist attitude of the men in the group.
            Thus the next time I ran the exercise with a hospital group
          I made a few salient changes. First, I replaced one of the 10
          characters with a super macho 450-pound world champion
          wrestler. The guys were going to love it. He would definitely
          make it into the top five. Definitely, that is, until they read
          the description for the tenth choice. My new choice for
          number 10 was a female CIA sharp-shooter, with top secu-
          rity clearance, and extensive expertise in the martial arts.
          Best of all, my description of choice number 10 explained
          that she actually beat the 450-pound wrestler in an exhibition
          match of hand-to-hand combat.                     
            This time around the females were sitting where they
          should rightly sit — in the circle. Choice number 10 gave
          them power and spawned tremendous interaction in the
          group.                                            
            Whenever you use a group exercise — whether it is one
          you learned from a textbook, a professor, a supervisor, or a
          workshop — don’t be afraid to alter it to meet the needs of
          your particular client population. This principle is often
          applicable to exercises utilized in individual treatment as
          well. Unlike the old computer punch cards and modern credit
          card bills, group experiences usually work best if you bend,

         with.                                              
            Another way to enhance your sessions is to use small
         talk to build rapport with your clients. For example, Jamie’s
         mother sat in my office and said, “As I think I explained
         over the phone, Dr. Rosenthal, Jamie doesn’t want to see
         you. He doesn’t think he has a problem. So I guess what
         I’m trying to say is that on the way over here in the car he
         said he’s not going to talk to you. I hope we didn’t waste
         our time coming here today. He really needs the help, you
         know. All he talks about, Dr. Rosenthal, is that stupid car
         he’s saving up to buy. I don’t know. I suppose it’s hopeless.”
            “Wait a moment, Mrs. Wilson. What about that stupid
         car he wants to buy? Can you tell me anything about it?”
            “Oh, gosh. I don’t know. It’s some stupid old Pontiac, a
         1965. Let’s see, I think he called it a GTO. Why?” 
            “Mrs. Wilson, I’ve got good news for you,” I told her. “I
         think Jamie is going to talk. In fact, I think he’s going to
         talk a lot.”                                       
            I went to the waiting room and called Jamie’s name.
         Since my office was quite a distance from the waiting room
         I began my opening remarks before he ever entered the
         therapy room.                                      
            “You mom tells me you’ve got your eye on an interesting
         ’65 Goat. (Goat is slang for a Pontiac GTO. I’m banking on
         the fact that Jamie will know this.) Is the 389 (the size of
         the engine) a single four barrel (the carburetor), or is this
         one equipped with tri-power (three two-barrel carburetors)?”
            Jamie spoke. “Um, it’s a single four barrel. Those
         tri-power goats are rare you know.”                
            “Yeah, well I used to have a ’65 Olds 442. That’s the
         same body as the Goat.”                            
            Now Jamie seemed to be hooked. “Hey, that’s cool. A
         442. What engine did yours have?”

          Before You See Your First Client                  
            Jamie could now see that his therapist wasn’t some big
          bad wolf who knew nothing about him. We both had some-
          thing in common — a mutual interest if you will. We both
          appreciated classic 1960’s muscle cars. And since we had
          something in common he decided he could talk to me which
          he did.                                           
            When I first began in this field I was taught that small
          talk had little or no place in the therapeutic process. I have
          found time and time again that it not only has a place but it
          is often the only way to build rapport with a resistant client.
          Let me give you another wonderful example.        
            A mother brought her son to me for therapy. Like Jamie,
          he told his mom he planned to remain uncommunicative and
          wasn’t going to talk to some “stupid counselor or therapist.”
          Actually, as you become experienced in this field you will
          discover that this attitude is not that uncommon, especially
          among children and adolescents.                   
            The youngster sarcastically told his mother that the only
          way he would consider speaking with me was if I could help
          him secure a stereo power amplifier. Little did this child
          know that I personally knew a great deal about stereo equip-
          ment and before my interview with him was over I gave him
          directions to an obscure pawn shop where he indeed did
          secure the type of power amplifier he was looking for.
            Obviously, not every case will go as smoothly as the two
          I have depicted. Helpers, nevertheless, will do well to look
          for a way to engage the client, especially if he or she is
          resistant. A knowledge of the subject matter is helpful.
          Although you cannot possibly know everything about every
          conceivable subject, even a minimal amount of information
          will help abet efficacious intervention. Often you can guess
          what topics will come up. Adolescents routinely take an
          interest in rock music, movie stars, and sports. When I
          worked closely with a managed care firm that services auto-

                                       Howard Rosenthal     
         motive assembly employees (and their kids, such as Jamie)
         I tried to keep up with trends in the automotive industry.
            And how can you build rapport if you are totally ignorant
         regarding the subject at hand? Simple. You ask questions
         about it. Clients frequently feel more at ease when they can
         express their expertise during an interview.       
            You can secure your ideas for small talk from parents
         and caretakers, the case history in the client’s file, jobs, or
         merely asking the client what he or she likes to do. Try this
         technique when building a good solid therapeutic relation-
         ship with a client. I have this notion you’ll discover that
         small talk really isn’t so small after all.

                                            Why             
            If a client was dissatisfied with his or her past helper I
          want to know why and you should too. Here are some typical
          statements you will hear from clients who were displeased
          consumers of psychotherapeutic services and strategies you
          might try to make their experience with you a more produc-
          tive one.                                         
          Complaint: My therapist talked too much and told me what
                to do.                                      
          Possible remedy: Try listening more, talking less, and be-
                ing a bit more nondirective or person-centered in
                terms of your therapeutic style.

          Before You See Your First Client                  
          Complaint: My counselor just sat and stared at me. He
                never said anything and never gave me any direc-
                tion.                                       
          Possible remedy: Talk more. Be more active-directive. The
                father of behavior therapy, Andrew Salter, had cli-
                ents of this ilk in mind when he wrote that helpers
                who couldn’t give advice would be more useful to
                society as elevator operators.              
          Complaint: All my helper ever talked about was her own
                problems.                                   
          Possible remedy: Stop yapping and start listening. You’ve
                taken the principle of self-disclosure too far. If it
                seems difficult to stop talking about the trials and
                tribulations of your own life consider seeing a ther-
                apist yourself! (See idea number 39 for additional
                insight regarding this issue.)              
          Complaint: All we ever did was analyze my childhood.
          Possible remedy: Try using an ahistoric or so-called
                present-moment approach that focuses upon the
                here and now. Behavioristic techniques could be
                appropriate.                                
          Complaint: We never really talked about the past. All we
                ever did was talk about the present. I need to know
                how I got to be this way.                   
          Possible remedy: If you are qualified try utilizing a psy-
                chodynamic approach that focuses more on the past
                and one’s childhood. Steer clear of behavioristic
                methods.                                    
          Complaint: My therapist was too philosophical. I never
                really understood what I was supposed to be doing
                or learning from our sessions.

         Possible remedy: Give the client behavioristic homework
               assignments and focus on cognitive-behavioral
               skills. Reality Therapy and Rational-Emotive Be-
               havior Therapy could well be the treatment of
               choice for such individuals.                 
            If something didn’t work maybe it’s time for a change.

                                       Diagnosis            
            I humorously tell my students and supervisees that I can
          remember a time when nearly everybody I knew was wear-
          ing a neck brace. Perhaps you remember it too. Whiplash
          was as commonplace as mom’s apple pie. Then there was
          the era of hypoglycemia. Everybody was depressed and act-
          ing a little crazy because they were gulping down too much
          sugar which in turn caused low blood sugar or hypoglyce-
          mia. Even the legal profession picked up on it and the
          so-called Twinkie Defense was born, i.e., he committed the
          crime because he ate too much sugar laden junk food.
            Recently more and more clients seem to fit the borderline
          personality diagnosis. And currently in the geographic area
          where I practice, kids are labeled ADHD (Attention Deficit
          Hyperactivity Disorder) by the droves. One of my students

          Before You See Your First Client                  
          works in a preschool where over 50 percent of the kids are
          diagnosed and subsequently medicated for ADHD.    
            Can we go too far with the “in” or avant-garde diagnoses?
          I say flatly that we can and I would like to share a few
          examples. A psychiatrist proclaimed as an ADHD specialist
          was asked during a lecture how she diagnoses kids so quickly
          in her office since she sees so many children each day. “I
          don’t really,” replied the doctor, “I assume that if the teacher
          sees ADHD behavior and sends the kid to me, he or she is
          correct. The condition is so prevalent.” I’m happy to report
          that numerous teachers in the audience took offense to this
          position and didn’t appreciate being put in the position of
          psycho-diagnostician.                             
            I once telephoned a psychiatrist to see if he would eval-
          uate my client for possible medication. I did not mention
          any diagnosis, much less ADHD. “If it’s a typical kid with
          ADHD  that needs Ritalin (a medicine often prescribed for
          this condition), I’ll see him,” replied the psychiatrist. “Oth-
          erwise I really wouldn’t have time to help.”      
            It’s really easy to fall into the trap of fitting a given
          diagnosis — even when it isn’t the “in” diagnosis. I recently
          read a list of behaviors to 66 students in my undergraduate
          class, Introduction to Human Services. Unbeknownst to
          them I had read the DSM criteria for ADHD. Nearly every
          student had all the necessary behaviors to take on the label.
          Perhaps even more amazing was the story told to me by a
          professor in a medical school. He claims that when the AIDS
          epidemic first broke out he read the World Health Organi-
          zation’s symptoms of AIDS to literally hundreds of students
          without telling them what illness the symptoms corre-
          sponded to. Nearly everybody he read them to came up with
          a positive diagnosis!                             
            The point is certainly not to deny that whiplash, ADHD,
          hypoglycemia, and borderline personality disorder exist.
          Such conditions do exist and no doubt in fairly high num-

         bers. If, however, nearly everybody who crosses your path
         ends up with the diagnosis of the month, then it’s time to
         give up sugar, take the neck brace off, and do a little intro-
         spection.

                     About   Your Own   Recovery            
            Sally is 23 and single. Since her agency does a great deal
          of marriage counseling, her greatest fear is that a new client
          will inquire whether she has personally tied the knot.
          George, on the other hand, works at a child guidance clinic.
          His worry is that clients may become alarmed should they
          discover that he has no children. Craig is apprehensive that
          the clients in the chemical dependency unit will discount his
          input if they are privy to the fact that he has never been a
          substance abuser.                                 
            I have some surprising yet pleasant news for Sally,
          George, and Craig, based on my 20-plus years of clinical
          experience. Don’t lose any sleep over it. I can remember
          when I personally had precisely the same concerns. What I
          discovered, however, was that my clients were so preoccu-

102                            
          Before You See Your First Client                  
          pied with their own concerns that they rarely, if ever, grilled
          me in regard to my personal life.                 
            Don’t get me wrong. I firmly believe that a married
          couple has a right to know if their counselor is married. A
          mother struggling with the terrible twos certainly has a right
          to ascertain whether her helper has done the same, and an
          alcoholic is within his boundaries when he inquires about
          your history concerning a battle with the bottle. In fact, I
          feel that such clients are justified in asking for another helper
          if you don’t possess the proper “life credentials.”
            I learned early in my career that although a client has
          every right to inquire about such particulars, only a few ever
          do. In general, clients are a lot more interested in overcoming
          their own difficulties than they are about the fact that you
          are single and have never raised a toddler.       
            I’ll never forget my initial experiences in terms of
          self-disclosure. Even when my disclosures were concise, it
          was not unusual for a client to change the subject back to
          his or her personal situation and, in some cases, the client
          would interrupt me to do so.                      
            The aforementioned phenomenon explains why clients
          do not want to hear long-winded stories about your own
          recovery. Some self-disclosure is indeed therapeutic. Nev-
          ertheless, when you go on ad nauseam about your own past
          I can almost guarantee you that the client (or clients, if you
          work in a group setting) will find it boring, distasteful, and
          hardly conducive to effective treatment. In essence, if you
          are roughly the opposite of Sally, George, and Craig, enter-
          ing this field primarily to talk at length about the gory details
          of your own recovery, you will be sadly disappointed.
            If you feel compelled to go on with endless tales of woe
          —  you know those long-winded how-I-got-high-     
          on-LSD-in-the-sixties sagas — about your own struggle for
          improvement, then let me suggest that countertransference
          has set in. My advice would be to find a good therapist and

         go pour your heart out. Clients come to talk about them-
         selves. The rule of thumb regarding self-disclosure is that
         while a little bit is good, a lot isn’t necessarily better.

                                   Psychotherapy            
            An accomplished behavior therapist was treating a
          woman who was convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt that
          behavior therapy was superficial. The woman expressed a
          desire to “do it right.” She was certain that she needed a
          form of psychodynamic therapy, most likely full-fledged
          Freudian psychoanalysis. The woman expressed her discon-
          tentment again and again, but the behavior therapist kept
          reassuring her that behavioristic methods were superior.
            When the woman’s protests became overwhelming, the
          therapist suggested he would give her strict Freudian anal-
          ysis for six sessions. He told her that she would have to sign
          a behavior contract (how’s that for a paradox?) indicating
          that if the analysis didn’t work, he would go back to a
          behavioristic approach. The behaviorist fully expected that
          the “depth psychology” treatment would be a dismal failure.

          The client signed the contract and the new treatment para-
          digm was underway.                                
            The behavior therapist, who possessed absolutely no
          training in psychoanalysis,* told the client to free associate.
          At other times he focused on her dreams and made interpre-
          tations about her formative years and her unconscious mind.
          At the end of the six sessions the woman was symptom free
          and did not feel the need for additional treatment.
            Does this saga prove that behavior therapy is inferior to
          classical Freudian analysis? No, but it does illustrate that
          one form of psychotherapeutic intervention will not work in
          every case. The therapeutic strategy that worked wonders
          for your nine o’clock client will often fall flat on its face at
          10. In fact, the modality that worked so well for your nine
          o’clock client this week could very well be a disaster with
          that same nine o’clock client next week. If you must be
          married to a single system of psychotherapy or counseling,
          try to be as flexible as possible within the confines of that
          particular modality. I often tell my students that I wouldn’t
          trust my life — or my clients’ lives — to any one system
          of psychotherapy.                                 
          *This treatment was performed about 20 years ago. Ethical guidelines currently
          suggest that helpers should not treat clients utilizing modalities in which they
          have no training.

                                        Presenter           
            I had completed a two-day mental health workshop for
          elementary and secondary school personnel. As I was pack-
          ing up my materials to leave the building a woman, who
          appeared to be in her early sixties, approached me.
            “Dr. Rosenthal,” she said, “I just wanted you to know
          how much I enjoyed your presentation. In fact, I must say
          candidly that you gave the best speech I’ve heard in over 25
          years of this field.”                             
            Was I pleased? Of course, I was ecstatic. Who wouldn’t
          want to hear praise like that from a highly experienced
          teacher who came across so sincere?               
            “What was it that you liked so much?” I asked. Was it
          my statistics? Was she impressed with my theoretical notions
          or rigorous therapeutic recommendations?

            “Oh, heck no,” she replied, “I could have learned that
          stuff from any text book. It was your enthusiasm that was
          so striking. I believe I lost mine years ago and you rekindled
          it in just two days.”                             
            On another occasion I gave a lecture at a local college
          and a professor liked it so much she offered me a teaching
          job. When I asked her what caught her fancy she noted that
          I came into the room like a tornado. “You were just so
          enthusiastic,” she added. Just for the record, I took the teach-
          ing job.                                          
            On another occasion my zeal landed me a free trip to Las
          Vegas to give a keynote speech for an international organi-
          zation.                                           
            Enthusiastic lectures and workshops can open profes-
          sional doors for you, in terms of building your reputation
          and your practice (or that of your agency), and help those
          who reap the benefits of your wisdom. Remember that it’s
          not what you say, but the way you say it that often makes
          all the difference in the world.

            I hired Farrah because I couldn’t keep up with the
          requests I was getting for my suicide prevention speeches.
          The game plan was simple enough. Farrah, who had a great
          deal of expertise in self-destructive behavior patterns, would
          tag along with me for say five or 10 lectures. By doing so
          she would not only familiarize herself with the material but
          could also emulate my speaking style.             
            After about two weeks Farrah had committed my modus
          operandi to memory. She knew the material, the jokes, the
          silences, and even the vocal inflections. Then came the big
          day. Farrah got in front of her first audience, a private girl’s
          high school, as I sat watching. As Farrah began to lecture,
          the young ladies instantly began to squirm in their seats. A
          few were beginning to nod off and one young lady in the

          front row was sleeping so soundly her snoring was nearly
          as loud as Farrah’s voice.                        
            When we processed what had happened Farrah was  
          bewildered. She indicated that she was certain she did every-
          thing precisely the way I would have done it. I suggested
          that she was correct, but that perhaps that was the problem.
          Farrah had her own personality and her own style. Since she
          knew the material I admonished her to be herself the next
          time she was called on to present. From that point on Farrah
          became an adroit lecturer in her own right.       
            Never lose sight of the fact that your personality is dif-
          ferent than anyone else’s. Farrah came across poorly when
          she tried to be my clone. Remember what happened to me
          earlier in the book when I tried to clone Milton Erickson?
          My personal attributes were obviously a lot different than
          Erickson’s.                                       
            When a therapeutic or workshop technique works for one
          person it may need to be bent, folded, or mutilated, just like
          the group exercises I mentioned earlier, to meet your own
          needs and the needs of your clients or audience. Just say no
          to therapeutic and presentation clone experiments.

            Lloyd Weber had been counseling Donna Clayton for a
          little more than four years. During that time she made numer-
          ous improvements in her life. As she put it, she would be
          “forever indebted” to Lloyd for his help. Initially, Donna
          was certain she would leave her husband Sid. She rejected
          the idea that the marriage was salvageable as well as the
          possibility that marriage counseling could be helpful. After
          all, the way she described the relationship, Sid was lazy,
          aloof, an inept parent, and emotionally abusive. As Donna
          began to perceive the situation differently, she and Lloyd

          agreed that marital counseling might be the treatment of
          choice after all.                                 
            In a short period of time the flavor of the sessions
          changed for Donna. During a phone call, she said to Lloyd
          following their initial session as a couple:      
            “I feel hurt and betrayed. I thought you were on my side,
          but now I can see that I thought wrong. I can’t believe your
          comment implying that at times I’m a bit abrasive. I’m not
          the one who is verbally abusive. It’s Sid! I’m not the one
          who shirks my duty as a parent. It’s Sid! I can’t believe it.
          One session and he’s manipulated you. Now you think I’m
          the problem. I never should have trusted you. You’re just
          like everyone else who is fooled by his charm.”   
            The therapist had fallen out of good graces with his client.
          Is this situation atypical? I think not. Although I would
          concede that it does not occur in every instance, it happens
          more than most seasoned helpers would care to remember.
            Agreeing to see a client’s significant other, after you have
          seen the client for an extended period of time, is one of the
          most pernicious therapeutic blunders I have encountered.
          The client who has built a powerful long-term relationship
          with the counselor — like Donna — often feels that the
          therapist is no longer on her or his side.        
            My advice to helpers faced with this dilemma is really
          quite simple. If you have any doubt whatsoever that the
          treatment could go downhill when you begin seeing a sig-
          nificant other, then don’t. Instead enlist the help of a fellow
          counselor whom you trust and refer such cases out. In most
          cases it is best to continue to see your client while the
          couple’s counseling is ongoing. Perhaps, your fellow col-
          league could even reciprocate and refer his marital and cou-
          ples counseling to you.

                               Moment’s    Notice           
            Thirteen-year-old Gloria suffered from Trichotillomania,
          a condition in which the client pulls out his or her hair and
          then on occasion eats it. Gloria was described by her mother
          as “unusually perceptive” and “brilliant.”        
            I began the initial interview using a strict nondirective,
          person-centered paradigm. I felt I was doing a superb job
          until she introduced the fact that the treatment wasn’t going
          anywhere fast. In fact, it was going nowhere.     
            Gloria said, “You know. Every time I say something, you
          kind of repeat it in your own words and you seem to under-
          stand exactly what I feel. And you’re very kind, sincere, and
          caring. But that isn’t all there is to counseling, is it? I mean
          we both know you are going to do something different to
          help me stop pulling my hair.”

          Before You See Your First Client                  
            I didn’t know whether Gloria was just as her mother put
          it “extremely perceptive,” a spy who had somehow infiltrated
          my graduate classes, or a precocious 13-year-old critic of
          Rogerian therapy!                                 
            At that moment I learned what it really meant to be an
          effective therapist. I acquiesced with Gloria and explained
          that reflection and paraphrasing were simply used for the
          first few minutes and then we would swing into action. In
          essence I literally changed gears in the midst of the session.
          I ended up treating Gloria with behavioral techniques such
          as charting, positive reinforcement, and making her wear
          three-pound ankle weights on her wrists so she wouldn’t
          unconsciously pull her hair as she watched TV. (She would
          either stop pulling her hair or would end up with biceps like
          Arnold Schwarzenegger.) In a very short period of time
          Gloria was relieved of this dis-tressing habit.   
            On another occasion I was hypnotizing a client. Just as
          I thought she was becoming extremely relaxed she opened
          her eyes and said: “I’ve never told anybody this but I was
          sexually abused when I was eight years old. Do you think
          that is something important that we should talk about?”
          Needless to say, her recollections about her abuse consumed
          what was left of our session. Insisting we continue with the
          hypnosis would have been foolish.                 
            In cases like this I tend to believe that the client is gen-
          erally right in the sense that he or she can tell whether the
          intervention is productive. In the aforementioned instances
          I am almost certain that if I had continued with my original
          game plan, the result would have been less than desirable.
            When something isn’t working and the client lets you
          know it, assess the situation at hand and if necessary alter
          your course of action.

                             Road  to Promotion             
            My friend Martha was furious. For an entire year she
          threw her heart and soul into being the best child abuse
          counselor in the office. Her supervisor, however, did not give
          her a promotion and the raise that went with it.  
            “What was your supervisor’s rationale?” I wanted to
          know.                                             
            “She told me that she doesn’t really know what I do when
          I’m behind closed doors with a client. She goes by what is
          written in the record and I guess the dictation in my records
          wasn’t all that great.”                           
            There’s a saying in the helping field suggesting that if
          you “didn’t write it down, it didn’t happen.” Each year
          hundreds of workers are penalized for less than desirable
          documentation skills.                             
            The executive director of a large residential treatment
          center for children and adolescents once told me that he

          would hire an individual with a two-year associate’s degree
          over one with a master’s degree, if the helper with the
          two-year degree was a good writer and the one with the
          master’s degree wasn’t. A strong statement indeed, but cer-
          tainly indicative of the importance of the written word in
          the process of helping others.                    
            Although you needn’t write like Faulkner or Hemingway,
          you must be able to write in a coherent manner that allows
          others to understand what is transpiring between you and
          your client.                                      
            Here’s a neat little trick. If your writing is a little shaky
          try dictating what you write into a tape recorder. Then listen
          to it. If it doesn’t make sense rewrite it so it does make sense
          when you listen to the tape. Your supervisor, your client,
          your self-esteem, and your promotion committee will thank
          you for it!

            Sonya had a 1964 Ford Thunderbird that she drove to
          work each day. Mr. Townsend, who was in her 10 o’clock
          assertiveness training group, had his eye on it and told her
          so. Mr. Townsend was the owner of a restoration garage
          about 50 miles south of the counseling facility. Before and
          after group he would explain to Sonya that for just a few
          hundred dollars he could make some minor repairs and put
          a few coats of custom metallic paint on her car. He assured
          her that she would be driving a customized classic that
          anyone would be proud to own.                     
            The most seductive part of the offer was that Sonya had
          indeed priced the repairs on her T-Bird, and that, combined
          with a show-car paint job, would set her back several thou-
          sand dollars. The only thing holding her back was the fact
          that she was Mr. Townsend’s therapist. Finally, the urge to

          restore her dream car was overpowering. “How could it
          possibly alter the therapy process?” she thought. 
            Sonya’s T-Bird thus ended up in Mr. Townsend’s resto-
          ration shop; though Sonya thought it looked more like an
          old barn on his farm when she finally saw it. For two weeks
          Mr. Townsend mentioned nothing about her car. Sonya was
          becoming apprehensive and it seemed to be affecting her
          therapeutic technique. She was responding to Mr. Townsend
          noticeably less in group and he was speaking up less.
            Finally — after four long weeks — Sonya confronted
          her client about the status of her car. He explained to her
          that he had been unusually busy and that he really didn’t
          have time to work on her automobile. When Sonya was
          finally able to get a ride into the country to pick up her
          vehicle, Mr. Townsend said that he was just charging her
          $50 for some minor mechanical operations he had per-
          formed. When she inquired about specifics, he told her that
          he did some work on the inside of the left door and made a
          few adjustments on her automatic transmission. These, need-
          less to say, were repairs that Sonya couldn’t verify, and she
          was convinced the repairs were figments of Mr. Townsend’s
          imagination.                                      
            The next day Sonya gave him the evil eye in group, while
          Mr. Townsend, who had traditionally been verbal, stared at
          the floor and said nothing. He dropped out of group the next
          day without explaining his rationale and never came back.
          Sonya — now a victim of severe countertransference — was
          secretly happy to see him go.                     
            Sonya was engaging in what is known in the trade as a
          dual relationship. A dual relationship occurs when a therapist
          wears two hats. That is to say: Your therapist or helper is
          also your relative, boyfriend, house painter, or as in the case
          of Sonya, your customer. In simple terms, the therapist plays
          the role of your helper, but also plays another role in the
          client’s life.

            The best advice I can give any helper — regardless of
         training or clinical persuasion — regarding dual relation-
         ships is to stay away from them. Heed my warning. Nearly
         every dual relationship will end in disaster. That is why
         almost all ethical guidelines advise against them. 
            Recently, however, ethical guidelines have become a tad
         more liberal when it comes to dual or so-called multiple
         relationships. These guidelines indicate that the practice may
         be ethical if you live in a small town where such relationships
         are unavoidable or constitute the cultural norm. The ethical
         bodies do emphasize that when you do engage in a dual
         relationship you should make certain that the client is not
         exploited. If you have a situation that you truly believe falls
         into these new guidelines, I highly recommend that you
         discuss the situation with your supervisor, as well as an
         attorney on your staff or board. Finally, many liability and
         malpractice carriers now provide practitioners with a
         toll-free number for ethical and legal advice. This is the ideal
         situation to take them up on their offer to use this service.

                         Insider Tips for a Good            
                       Cover  Letter and Human              
                                 Service Resumé             
            To sell yourself to an employer or private practice setting,
          these tips are at least as important as the notes you penned
          in your theories classes since they could likely help you
          snare yourself a job. You’ve no doubt already discovered that
          those theories aren’t overly useful if you don’t have a posi-
          tion to practice your craft.                      
            • Always send a cover letter with your resume. Both
              documents should be typed or word processed on
              white — or if you’re daring, off-white or light gray
              —  cotton bond paper, i.e., paper that has a water
              mark. Never use a dot matrix printer. Instead rely on
              a laser or a good ink-jet printer.            
            • When you write the salutation in your cover letter,
              rather than using a generic title, such as Dear Director

          Before You See Your First Client                  
               of Personnel or Dear Clinical Case Management Su-
               pervisor, address it to a name such as Mr. John Doe
               or Dr. Jane Doe. Make certain to spell the individual’s
               name correctly and if the individual has a doctorate,
               e.g., Ph.D., Ed.D., Psy.D., M.D., D.O. or D.S.W., be
               certain you use Dear Dr. and not Dear Mr. A lot of
               folks who have spent years burning the midnight oil
               to put the letters Dr. before their name get mighty
               ticked off (more than if you misspelled their name,
               but of course you’d never do that) when you don’t
               use it. Some could care less, but since you don’t know
               the individual, play it safe and refer to them as doctor.
               If you are uncertain about spelling or degrees, call
               the institution in question before sending your cover
               letter and resume.                           
             • If a person with some connections or clout has rec-
               ommended you for the job, forget about modesty and
               say so in the first paragraph. Also be specific about
               which position you are applying for. Even small agen-
               cies often advertise a number of positions concurrent-
               ly.                                          
             • Always send your resume and cover letter in an 8
                                                1

               by 11 large envelope. Many hospitals and agencies
               keep the envelopes on all the correspondence re-
               ceived. If you imagine a stack of 100 resumes and
               cover letters, which really isn’t that unusual in today’s
               job market, you can visualize yours — in the largest
               envelope — that means it is more likely to be read.
               Moreover, since a resume is a work of art, it must
               look good, and in addition to being a sale’s piece,
               your materials will remain unfolded.         
             • If you really want a job badly and aren’t exactly
               certain whether to stress this or that on your resume,
               you might try a controversial tactic called the
               split-half method. Send two slightly different re-
               sumes, one stressing this and one stressing that. Mail

              them at different times and under separate cover of
              course. This technique also lessens the statistical
              chance that you’ll just get passed over since you now
              have two entries rather than one in the resume stack.
              If you do secure an interview and the interviewer does
              catch this anomaly, simply tell him or her the truth
              that you decided to update your resume.       
            • Hobbies such as art, word processing, golf, or running
              a flea-market operation can often help you secure a
              job at not-for-profit agencies. I remember interview-
              ing two people for the position of volunteer coordi-
              nator once. Both were equally qualified, however, one
              listed flea market sales as her hobby. When I asked
              her how much money she could raise for our agency
              by holding a flea-market she assured me that she
              could bring over a thousand dollars for a day’s work.
              I believed her and after she was hired she more than
              delivered on her promise. A student of mine who
              listed desk-top publishing and writing as hobbies was
              later told that these were the deciding factors that led
              to her employment because the agency wanted to start
              a newsletter. Always keep in mind that not-for-profit
              social service and mental health agencies, unlike large
              for-profit corporations, often do not have the budget
              to purchase services that may merely be a pastime
              for you. Thus an avid golfer could be called upon to
              coordinate a fund raiser on the links.        
            • Emphasize the area of your experience relating to the
              job in question. If, for example, the position is basi-
              cally an educational one don’t focus strictly on clin-
              ical experience. You could, for example, list all the
              courses and/or workshops you have taught. In con-
              trast, a resume listing each and every course you have
              taught would be inappropriate for a job with a clinical
              slant.

             • If your professional experience in the field is minimal,
               create a heading such as Relevant Experience and list
               your practicum, internship, clerkship, or volunteer
               experience. Notice the heading is truthful in that it
               neither says nor implies that you were an employee
               or paid for the experience. Remember that your time
               flipping burgers or waiting on tables often isn’t
               enough. I have numerous students who send out re-
               sumes that depict no experience because they have
               never had a job in the field. Many of these students
               have had a myriad of service learning experiences
               and fail to list them on the resume because they were
               unpaid positions.                            
             • If your resume and cover letter do the job, and you
               land an interview and really want the job, immedi-
               ately send a thank you letter to the interviewer.

            It’s 15 minutes into the interview and your client has
          been droning on and on about her countless squabbles with
          her younger sister. This is a familiar tale of woe that you’ve
          heard more times than you care to remember. At times you
          could finish the sentences for her.               
            As a fallible human, your mind begins to wander. When
          your own personal daydream ends your client is still bab-
          bling on about her relationship difficulties. For a moment
          you wonder if your client noticed that your mind was a
          million miles away.                               
            “No,” you conclude, “I’m certain she didn’t know the
          difference.” Don’t be so sure.

          Before You See Your First Client                  
            There’s a neat little exercise I perform with my college
          theories and skills class every semester. Everyone in the
          room picks a partner. One person plays the helper, the other
          the client. Then I separate the two groups. I explain to the
          client-group that unbeknownst to the helper-group they will
          be rating their therapists on a scale of one to 100. An average
          helper, I explain, should be rated as a 50. A helper who is
          absolutely perfect should receive a rating of 100, while a
          therapist who is your worst nightmare can be given a rating
          of one.                                           
            Next I speak to the helper-group in private and explain
          they will have two brief four-minute mini-sessions with their
          client. Unbeknownst to the client-group I admonish the help-
          ers to purposely allow their minds to wander during the
          initial trial. With the second trial, however, the helpers are
          told to hang onto every word the client says, no matter how
          difficult that might be.                          
            Certainly you can guess what happens every time. When
          the helper is not listening the client notices it, perhaps even
          unconsciously, and rates the person playing the counselor
          significantly lower than in the second trial. In fact, it isn’t
          that unusual to have a person receive a score of zero and
          then a score hovering around the 100 mark.        
            This principle is pervasive in the sense that it transcends
          any theory of counseling, therapy, or intervention you use.
            It is thus imperative to remember that whether you want
          to admit it or not, your client will notice if you’re not paying
          attention. So tune in and turn your client on to efficacious
          treatment.

            When I finished my master’s degree I saw an advertise-
          ment for a hypnotist at a new smoking cessation center.
          When I arrived at the interview, the owner of the practice
          excused himself and said he would return momentarily
          which he did. Much to my surprise he now had a cigarette
          in his mouth and was puffing away. The rest of the pack was
          peeking out of the pocket from his white dress shirt.
            The shock must have shown on my face for he smiled
          slyly and boasted, “Hey, Rosenthal. Don’t look so darn
          shocked. This is a luxury I don’t have during the day. I don’t
          really believe in my product, do you?”            
            Here was someone hawking “stop smoking via hypnosis”
          who not only smoked but didn’t even believe in hypnosis. It
          was kind of like finding out that the new car salesman who
          sold you a new Chevrolet really drives a Ford. He went on

          Before You See Your First Client                  
          to explain at length how much money he expected to make
          with his hypnosis scheme.                         
            I didn’t take the job and privately prognosticated that his
          center would be out of business in six months. Actually, I
          overestimated his longevity. He closed up shop in six weeks.
          Now I don’t know it for a fact but I can almost bet you that
          the clients (consciously or unconsciously) could sense that
          this snake-oil peddler didn’t believe in his product. And if
          you don’t believe in your product, I’m betting you can’t sell
          it to your client. What’s more, I don’t care if the product is
          hypnosis, family therapy, NLP, TA, REBT, behavior therapy,
          or anything else you could conjure up.            
            In another example of my helping philosophy and voca-
          tional choice, a young lady from a residential treatment
          center came to one of my undergraduate classes in an attempt
          to recruit volunteers and practicum students. At the time, her
          site had a reputation as the most popular volunteer/practicum
          agency in the city. Thus, selling my students on the idea of
          using her facility should have been a piece of cake. As the
          representative gave her sales pitch I could sense that deep
          down she didn’t believe in what they were doing. Something
          was obviously wrong. In fact, I couldn’t help but think that
          I could have easily done a better job of firing the students
          up and I wasn’t even working for her agency.      
            Not surprisingly, although she spoke with my three larg-
          est classes not a single student chose to work at her center.
          Some of the students remarked that she seemed ambivalent
          about the center although to be sure everything she said
          about the facility was positive. Somehow, her nonverbal
          communication was telegraphing a different message to the
          students and me. At the time I remember wondering if there
          was a way I could confirm my suspicions without asking her.
            About two weeks later I was shopping in a discount store
          and ran into her. She immediately began by telling me that
          she was no longer an employee of the center. She quit

         because she really didn’t like the way they were handling
         the clients and it was causing her discord. Although she
         confided that she had not as yet found another job and her
         bank account was falling rapidly she was convinced she
         made the right move getting out. She seemed surprised when
         I told her that her real feelings were evident during her
         presentation.                                      
            If you don’t believe in yourself, your treatment modality,
         or your agency, neither will your clients.

            My friends and family were gathered in my living room
          hovering around the television with a large bag of popcorn,
          a bowl of chips, and plenty of soft drinks. Everyone gazed
          at the clock as it moved toward the magic five o’clock hour.
          Earlier that day a massive news truck from a major TV
          station, replete with a satellite dish on top, had been parked
          in our driveway. I had given the anchorwoman a report that
          would be aired in a few moments.                  
            “Look you’re on the air,” shouted my wife Patti. Much
          to everyone’s chagrin, there I was on the 32-inch screen
          espousing my thoughts on mental health when everyone in
          the room, including me, broke into a fit of hysterical laughter.
          The caption identified me as my colleague in practice next
          door. When I called the station to protest, the fellow who

          Before You See Your First Client                  
          took my call chuckled and said that it would not be rectified
          for the 10 o’clock edition. Just for the record, he was correct.
            The media can be your friend or your foe; they can make
          or break your reputation. I’ve always tried to cooperate with
          the press. When I worked as the program director for a local
          crisis center, television, radio, and newspaper articles helped
          immensely in terms of keeping us supplied with volunteers
          and donors. On other occasions the media has helped me
          secure private practice clients, sell books, and garner lecture
          engagements. All in all, the media can do a great deal to
          promote your practice and/or agency.              
            Nevertheless, I urge you not to get your hopes up too
          high for I can almost guarantee you will be sadly disap-
          pointed if you don’t expect a number of minor or perhaps
          even major glitches to occur when you deal with the media.
          Let me share a few of the most common ones.       
             • I have been interviewed for newspaper articles that
               appeared in the smallest freebie county periodicals to
               the largest newspapers in the U.S., for example, the
               National Enquirer and USA Today. In most of the
               articles something I said was taken out of context or
               I was misquoted. You should expect the same. I still
               find it humorous that one newspaper quoted me as
               saying that “10 out of every hundred kids will commit
               suicide.” If that were true we wouldn’t have many
               kids left. On one occasion after giving a lecture in a
               small town, the front page lead story had a huge
               picture of me pointing my finger at the reader. The
               caption beneath the photo read, to my horror, “Coun-
               selor blames society for teen suicide.”      
             • When conducting long drawn-out interviews with
               television and/or cable news reporters, you should
               realize that the actual time you will appear on TV
               will be incredibly short — if your interview appears

133                            
                                       Howard Rosenthal     
              at all. Incidentally, when your interview is butchered
              or doesn’t air, don’t take your anger out on the re-
              porter who interviewed you. The final results, and this
              is true for print media as well, have often been de-
              cided by editors, producers, and program managers.
              Also a big local or national story will often preempt
              or postpone your piece and keep it out of the media.
              If the largest building in town catches fire or a national
              figure dies, don’t expect to see yourself on the tube
              that night talking about reality therapy groups.
            • Have you ever seen a nationally known expert appear
              on a television talk show and thought, I could have
              done a better job answering that question? Don’t be
              so sure. Unbeknownst to you, as well as the rest of
              the viewing audience, is that at the very moment the
              expert began to answer the question a card was
              flashed in front of him or her stating, “30 seconds
              until the commercial.” Mentally prepare for this sit-
              uation since there’s a good chance you will come face
              to face with it, if and when you grace the silver screen.
            • Do not make the assumption that national shows are
              better to deal with than those on a local level. I could
              relate a number of dreadful horror stories, but I will
              limit my discussion to a few well-chosen examples.
              After I spent six weeks helping a national talk show
              prepare a show, I was told when I arrived at the studio
              that there was only room for the clients on the set,
              but I was welcome to sit back stage and watch the
              program on the monitor. I had been told upfront that
              I would be the expert on the show that day. Hey,
              thanks guys. That’s really kind. In a number of in-
              stances shows have called me literally begging me to
              help them secure a client for a given segment related
              to mental health or counseling. I was told that if I
              could secure a client for a given show they would
              plug one of my books. “Imagine the exposure your

          Before You See Your First Client                  
               book will get,” they reminded me. “It would cost you
               thousands in advertising.” The media is correct about
               one thing. I have always resorted to imagination. I
               have never had a show on the national level follow
               through on this promise even on occasions when they
               said I needed to overnight express books to the pro-
               gram manager, at my cost of nearly $100. Local
               shows, however, have occasionally followed through
               in this regard.                              
             • Think twice before you recommend a client for a talk
               show. A client I recommended for a national talk
               show was told during a commercial break that the
               audience and the advertisers wanted her to scream
               and cry. My client protested that she thought this
               show was devoted to those who had problems and
               were now able to take charge of their emotions. An
               18-year-old client of mine did an interview for an-
               other national show the same day the Gulf War broke
               out. Since her segment was not used the day it was
               filmed she was told to call the show daily long dis-
               tance — at her expense — to discover whether the
               show was going to air on that particular day. After
               six months her mother decided they could no longer
               afford the daily long-distance call. About a year later
               a friend of hers called to say that she had seen her
               on national television and luckily had been video
               taping the show that day. This national show never
               even had the courtesy to call my client to inform her
               when she was going to be on the air.         
            The media can help you reach thousands, if not millions,
          of individuals who you could never reach otherwise. Just
          remember that when you deal with the media, Murphy’s
          Law, which asserts that if something can go wrong it will,
          seems to be in full force. Also — and this is crucial — it is
          imperative that you ask your supervisor what the agency or

=== Page 150 (1 cols) ===

                                       Howard Rosenthal     
         hospital communication policy is regarding the media. Many
         agencies have strict policies regarding who can and cannot
         speak with the media. In addition, your supervisor or director
         may issue a statement for all staff if an incident attracts
         media attention. Find out before you do the wrong thing and
         get yourself in hot water.

            Rebecca Simms had spent the last four years of her life
          creating an innovative therapeutic game to help co-depen-
          dent women. Needless to say, she was absolutely delighted
          when a large company bought the game from her for a
          significant amount of money.                      
            To celebrate, Rebecca decided to take her executive direc-
          tor of the counseling agency where she worked at out to
          lunch. When Rebecca broke the news to her director she was
          taken aback by her director’s reaction. Instead of praising or
          congratulating Rebecca, her director was downright mean
          and hostile. Her director castigated her for not telling her
          about the project sooner and told Rebecca that any money
          or royalties she received would go to the agency. Was
          Rebecca’s experience atypical? Hardly. Many agencies have
          an even more inflexible and stern policy.

          Before You See Your First Client                  
            Some agencies have a strict policy that anything you
          create, such as a book, a pamphlet, an assessment device, a
          cassette tape, or video, that is related to mental health or
          social service becomes the property of the agency. In fact,
          your agency may even copyright the product under the
          agency’s name. One rationale is that the agency is paying
          you to create the product or document. However, I must
          point out that some agencies assume ownership of your
          product even if you created your product totally on your own
          time.                                             
            If you have a project in mind and don’t want your agency
          to steal your idea, glory, royalties, or hard work, then I
          recommend you discuss your project before you sign on the
          dotted line to take the job. In fact, I would probably take the
          matter one step further and have your agency, hospital,
          school, or practice sign a legal agreement created by your
          attorney that clearly states your rights and ownership in
          regard to your creation. What do you do if your current or
          future place of employment won’t sign the contract? Well,
          that’s up to you and how committed you are to your project.
          For example, I know of one case where a professional quit
          his job so he could write a book and keep the royalties.
            The same basic principle applies when you are starting
          your own practice. Here again, your employer could specify
          that you cannot practice in the same vicinity or catchment
          area. Others may flat out stipulate that you cannot have an
          outside practice at all if you are employed at their facility.
          Unfortunately most helpers never bother to research such
          matters prior to securing employment. The good news is that
          you won’t be one of them.

                           Malpractice  Insurance           
            Following college, I secured employment at a state
          agency where we would routinely transport clients in our
          automobiles. For over 10 years my colleagues and I repeat-
          edly asked if we were covered in the event of an accident
          happening with a client or clients. Despite our pleas for an
          answer we were always told that they (whoever “they” were)
          would get back to us. The reason we wanted coverage from
          our employer was that our personal auto insurance premiums
          would have gone sky high if we asked for coverage to trans-
          port clients.                                     
            Finally, I called my insurance agent who chuckled and
          said, “Howard, if you were covered, they would simply tell
          you that you were covered.”

          Before You See Your First Client                  
            It is also a gross misconception to assume that your
          agency has a malpractice policy, or what is often called
          professional liability, which covers you. I remember when
          I was the program director for a helpline and our insurance
          company informed us that (at least at that time) we were
          one of only a handful of centers in the U.S. that had mal-
          practice for staff and volunteers.                
            A lot of factors affect the price you will pay for malprac-
          tice insurance. Students usually pay considerably less than
          licensed professionals. When comparing licensed profes-
          sionals, social workers usually pay the lowest fees. Licensed
          counselors generally pay a higher rate and those persons
          who are licensed as psychologists pay the stiffest price tags.
          The type of work you do also makes a huge difference.
            Let’s take an actual example. As I write this page I am
          looking at an insurance rate card for professional counselors.
          A full-time counselor employed in a K–12 school would pay
          $263 a year for a $2-million claim/$4-million aggregate
          claim policy. If that same counselor drops to 15 hours or
          less a week, then he or she is considered part-time and the
          rate drops to $197. If that same counselor is employed at an
          agency, practice, or hospital the rate shoots up to $431 or
          $323 for a part-timer. If that same counselor decides to take
          the big step and go into private practice, or what the insur-
          ance company calls a “self-employed counselor,” then the
          counselor will now pay a whopping $573 or $430 for 15
          hours a week or less.                             
            Now if you were peering over my shoulder at this moment
          you might look at the rate card and comment that our
          self-employed counselor could save a bundle — $253
          full-time or $190 part-time — by taking a $200,000/$200,000
          policy. You could assert that in your concerted opinion the
          counselor doesn’t realistically need that mega $2-million/
          $4-million policy. Unfortunately, even if you are correct it
          probably won’t matter. You see managed care companies

                                       Howard Rosenthal     
         often stipulate how much insurance self-employed practitio-
         ners must carry and I have to admit I haven’t seen any
         recently with the $200,000/$200,000 cost-effective bar-
         gain-basement rate policy. The minimum is usually $1-mil-
         lion/$3-million or the aforementioned $2-million/$4-million
         policy.                                            
            Therapists who supervise others, do hypnosis, or work
         with psychotic clients may also be asked to pay a higher
         rate. Interestingly enough, the direction that a profession
         chooses to take could also have a profound influence on what
         you pay. For example, psychologists have been trying to
         secure the right to dispense psychiatric medicinals for a
         number of years. Now that some areas are allowing psychol-
         ogists to prescribe medicine, I can guarantee you that these
         psychologists will see drastic increases in their malpractice
         insurance premiums.                                
            There is no way to beat the system, nevertheless, there
         are a few ways to make it more palatable. Professional
         organizations, such as the American Counseling Association
         (ACA), nearly always offer policies to members. I have
         found that as a general rule these organizations provide
         helpers a fair deal. Their rates are generally lower than
         competitors simply because they are buying a huge number
         of policies. However, they will usually stipulate that you
         must be a member of their organization to be eligible for a
         policy. When you figure the price of the membership plus
         the policy price, the total bill is often almost identical to the
         price you would pay if you went directly through a malprac-
         tice carrier. Thus, even though you really end up paying
         almost the same price, you’re getting a membership (usually
         replete with newsletters, journals, discounts on conferences,
         and other perks) thrown in. Organizations sometimes offer
         discounts for certifications or attending workshops they
         sponsor pertaining to legal or ethical matters.

          Before You See Your First Client                  
            Malpractice insurance companies who specialize in this
          field and advertise in professional publications, and profes-
          sional organizations, such as ACA, will invariably offer you
          a better deal than what your friendly neighborhood insurance
          company can secure for you.                       
            My advice in terms of securing malpractice insurance is
          the antithesis of my advice regarding the use of strong ther-
          apeutic confrontation: sooner is definitely better than later.

                         Private Practice Is Not a          
                     Panacea  for Everything That           
                                         Ails You           
            I remember as if it happened yesterday. It was the early
          1970s and I was sitting in my abnormal psychology class. I
          leaned over and asked a student who worked as a teacher’s
          aide at the university why our abnormal psychology profes-
          sor missed class every time we had an exam. I figured that
          since the aide rubbed elbows with the faculty he might just
          have the inside scoop.                            
            My cohort furrowed his brow and whispered, “You really
          don’t know?” When I forthrightly admitted my ignorance,
          he replied, “The guy’s in private practice and he charges 50
          smackers an hour, man.”                           
            I was dumbfounded. I didn’t know anybody who made
          $50 an hour. I decided right then that I wanted to devote my
          life to helping others and I might as well do it with an
          overinflated bank account. For several years I almost forgot

          Before You See Your First Client                  
          about my goal of being in private practice but remembered
          it instantly after I landed my first job as a caseworker. My
          monthly salary was in the $500 range and that was before
          Uncle Sam took his share. When I began to worry that my
          bank was going to charge me a search fee for my deposits,
          private practice emerged in my conscious mind once again.
            Today — over 20 years later — the situation has not
          changed appreciably. Most new students, and helpers in
          agencies, hospitals, and schools still see private practice as
          a panacea, somewhat of a goldmine: Set your own hours,
          see the clients you want to see, and do your own thing while
          watching the cash roll in. Nice fantasy, but hardly based in
          reality. While it is true that the average salary for private
          practitioners is often higher than those who are employed,
          the numbers are highly misleading.                
            Who makes more: the therapist who is self-employed and
          rakes in $50,000 a year or the employed therapist who makes
          $35,000? The private practitioner will have to buy his own
          health insurance. Then he or she will need office space,
          furniture, a secretary, a phone system, a telephone answering
          system or service, a phone book ad, business cards, statio-
          nery, malpractice insurance, workshop fees, and a slew of
          other things that are paid for by nearly any employer. Let’s
          assume that the therapist is working under a percentage split
          (see Tip #1, Join Forces with a Psychiatrist to Open a
          Risk-Free Private Practice) with a psychiatrist or other men-
          tal health specialist and all of the aforementioned factors are
          paid for. (Although the likelihood of medical insurance
          being paid for would be exceedingly low.) Even if the split
          was 70 percent for the therapist and 30 percent for the office
          services, the therapist would have to make $50,000 from
          clients’ fees to take in $35,000. That means that you would
          need to conduct approximately 666 sessions a year or 13
          sessions a week at $70 per client.

                                       Howard Rosenthal     
            Now at first glance the act of conducting 13 sessions per
         week to make $35,000 a year seems rather easy. In fact, you
         might appropriately point out that most practitioners charge
         more than $70 a session and thus you could work even less.
         That’s where you’d be wrong. First, how many managed
         care companies pay $70 or $80 per hour for individual
         therapy? Ask a few of your friends in private practice, I think
         you’ll be surprised and I don’t mean pleasantly surprised. I
         have dealt with some that pay less than $40 per hour — yes,
         even if you have the title of doctor before your name.
            What’s more, $35,000 a year assumes every single client
         pays every penny of his or her bill. In this regard I can tell
         you that some clients do and others don’t. When I left my
         last office my clients owed me over $13,000 that I will never
         see.                                               
            How do I know I’ll never see it? These are people that
         were kindly told they needed to pay the bill. Then they were
         told we could work out a payment plan with them. Then
         they were given a limited time to make a payment before
         they were turned over to collections. The next step was to
         hire a collection agency. When the collection agency did
         everything they legally could the tab was a little over
         $13,000.                                           
            Dreamer that I am, I still believed these clients would
         make some payments. I thus sent a kind letter to everyone
         and told them they were no longer in collection. I further
         pointed out that I would only write them once and they could
         pay me whatever they could afford or thought was fair. I
         emphasized that they could send anything — even five dol-
         lars — and I would close their account in good standing. I
         further provided a return envelope. Can you imagine what
         you would do if you owed a credit card company say a
         couple thousand dollars and they sent you a letter like that?
         I know what I’d do. I’d call and ask if the company had
         made a mistake.

          Before You See Your First Client                  
            Colleagues and fellow college instructors thought it was
          an interesting experiment and nearly everyone I spoke with
          predicted that almost every client would send me something.
          At the end of the process one client — that’s it one — sent
          me $30 on a rather large bill and his check bounced. He did,
          however, remit a money order after I informed him what
          transpired. Nobody else even bothered to call or write me.
            Only one of my peers could empathize. A fellow who
          was in private practice next door to me revealed that he quit
          practicing in the area when clients owed him in excess of
          $20,000. “I couldn’t stand the countertransference,” he
          sheepishly remarked.                              
            Incidentally, I take full responsibility for this fiasco. I
          enabled clients to run up astronomical bills — one in excess
          of $2,400 — by not enforcing payment. Since that time I’ve
          become strict about collecting outstanding balances and I
          advise you to do the same. You’ll lose more clients, but you
          won’t be seeing all your clients pro bono. A wise policy is
          simply to tell the clients that you can’t see them unless their
          bill is current. A lot of nonprofit agencies live by this credo
          too.                                              
            The self-employed practitioner needs to ask her or him-
          self some important questions. What happens when she takes
          a cruise for a two-week summer vacation? How much 
          income has she brought in during that period? Nothing that
          isn’t residual. An employed practitioner generally gets vaca-
          tion pay. What if she misses a day, or worse yet, several
          weeks or months due to illness or pregnancy? Here too,
          full-time agency workers generally accrue sick-leave bene-
          fits. What happens when there’s snow on the ground and it’s
          too slick to go out for a few days? The full-time employed
          counselor, on the other hand, gets the usual check even if
          the agency shuts down for inclement weather. What happens
          when a helper working in private practice has six clients
          scheduled and it’s a beautiful summer-like day in the middle

         of the winter and everybody decides to play hooky and go
         on a picnic? Again, no money comes in. When you work
         full-time at an agency, at a hospital, or as a school counselor
         you still get a check even when no clients wander through
         the door.                                          
            And remember, even if the private therapist never takes
         a day off and collects every dime he or she has coming, the
         individual still won’t receive any benefits. Thus, if a private
         practitioner wants to make the same as an agency, school,
         or hospital helper he or she needs to make a heck of a lot
         more in net income.                                
            Since it may well sound like I am bad-mouthing private
         practice let me clarify my position. I am not. In fact, for
         many years that is precisely what I did for the bulk of my
         income. The flexibility and prestige are nice. Overall, how-
         ever, I don’t think it is any better or worse than employed
         positions. Both have their pluses as well as their drawbacks.
         Yes, there are a lot of private practitioners who command
         high six-figure incomes, nevertheless, many self-employed
         helpers are in the same class as starving artists. The ones
         who are really raking in the big bucks are usually those who
         have a number of therapists working for them, either for
         salary or a percentage split, or they have magnificent referral
         sources.

                think is going on here?”                    
          Therapist: “Well quite frankly your situation really isn’t
                all that unusual.”                          
          Client: “You’re serious?”

                being sexually abused.”                     
          Therapist: “And that would go along with the theory.”
          Client: “Theory? What theory?”

          Before You See Your First Client                  
          Therapist: “The one that asserts that sexual abuse is such
                a horrendous trauma that the victim — in this case
                you — represses the entire memory.”         
          Client: “Oh my god. So it was so painful I forgot it.”
          Therapist: “Yes. Not on purpose or anything. I mean your
                mind is just trying to protect you.”        
          Client: “I know you truly know your field, but are you
                sure?”                                      
          Therapist: “It certainly makes sense doesn’t it?” 
          Client: “I guess … yes, I guess it does.”         
            This is a blatant example of a therapist leading the client
          and bad treatment. Here the therapist finds exactly what he
          or she expects to find. Unfortunately, the client has not
          provided the raw material to make such a finding. This helper
          has induced a condition known as False Memory Syndrome
          (FMS), the subject of numerous professional and popular
          articles in the media. In at least one case FMS made the
          cover of a national magazine that rarely if ever dabbles in
          psychotherapeutic topics.                         
            The rule regarding FMS is succinct and to the point: steer
          clear of it. Do not — I repeat — do not put words or ideas
          in the client’s head. First, the practice is unethical and,
          secondly, because you could easily create a problem for the
          helpee that never existed in the first place. If a client comes
          to his or her own conclusion that a memory has been
          repressed that’s fine — not to mention highly therapeutic.
          Nevertheless, your job is to avoid planting any seeds.

            If you believe in creative visualization, imagine this day.
          The client you felt you were helping the most yells at you
          and tells you you’re in the wrong profession. A second client,
          whom you thought was making progress, calls you three
          times because she is contemplating suicide. Your supervisor
          calls you in and questions your judgment regarding a recent
          therapeutic decision, and last but not least the mailman hand
          delivers a certified letter to you with a return receipt postcard
          indicating that a client — yes, the one you felt you did the
          most for — is suing you for malpractice.          
            You can bet you won’t feel elated when you get home.
          Especially not after the local traffic cop gave you a ticket
          for making a rolling stop after you left your client’s house
          where you were kind enough to conduct a home-visit therapy
          session.

            What usually happens after one of these trying days is
          that the individual feels badly. Doubt sets in and the helper
          begins to wonder if he or she is inept. Perhaps she even
          reaches emotional rock bottom, questioning if this is the
          right field for her.                              
            At this point I highly recommend my emotional trophy
          closet strategy.                                  
            An emotional trophy closet is merely a collection of your
          successes. You could easily compile an emotional trophy
          closet in a shoe box, a file drawer cabinet, or a three-ring
          binder. The emotional trophy closet consists of items
          intended to build your professional self-esteem and self-con-
          fidence.                                          
            You may want to include in your emotional trophy closet
          some of the following items. You might have a note or a
          rating from your supervisor (yes, the same one that ques-
          tioned your therapeutic judgment earlier in the day) that
          lauded your commendable performance. Perhaps you have
          a thank-you card from a client, patient, student, or fellow
          worker. Certificates of achievement are also highly recom-
          mended. An article from the local county journal could also
          be a part of it. Include anything and everything that makes
          you feel positive. If an item directly states or implies that
          you are a competent, accomplished professional then use it!
          This is no time for modesty!                      
            The next time your spirits dip or you question your abil-
          ities make a bee line for the closet. Remember to keep adding
          new and exciting treasures. After spending 10 minutes in
          your closet you’ll feel like a new man or woman.

                                      Conclusion            
            I gathered my materials from the podium and walked out
          the door of my Introduction to Human Services class. The
          hall was empty except for two of my students who were
          passively awaiting my exit.                       
            The young woman was 19 with light brown hair pulled
          back into a pony tail. The young man was 22, clean cut and
          closely cropped hair. He wanted to work in law enforcement
          and to be sure he already looked the part. Earlier in the
          semester, she had shared her aspiration to work with troubled
          kids, primarily those who had sustained sexual abuse.
            The young woman looked into my eyes with a degree of
          sincerity one does not often encounter. She asked, “Why do
          you do it, Dr. Rosenthal?”                        
            “Yeah,” said the young man, “I mean why do you still
          do it? You don’t have to.”                        
            The couple was referring to the fact that in addition to
          my full-time college teaching schedule I still counsel a hand-
          ful of clients each Saturday in my private practice.
            As I looked into their inquisitive eyes, I knew that I was
          looking at myself more than 20 years ago.

            The real question was why should anybody, including
          us, go into this profession. These students were seeking a
          serious answer. They needed an answer that came deep from
          the heart. Quoting a job description from the Dictionary of
          Occupational Titles or some government figures regarding
          potential openings in the coming years was not what they
          needed to hear.                                   
            I told them the following story: In 1974, I was doing
          casework for the state. I was young, about your age. One of
          my clients was a middle-aged woman who was living on
          public assistance and food stamps in an impoverished sec-
          tion of the city. Each time I visited her home she would read
          from her personal diary and on each occasion I was struck
          by the fact that this woman was an extremely talented writer.
          I repeatedly emphasized that she had a gift and I urged her
          to cultivate it by taking a writing course at the community
          college located just minutes from her house. Unfortunately,
          my recommendation was always met with resistance. 
            “Aw, I’m just another old welfare client, Mr. Rosenthal,”
          she would protest. “Nobody in my family has ever set a foot
          in a college and I suspect I won’t be any different.”
            Each time I thought I was about to make a breakthrough
          her low self-esteem would show its ugly teeth. Like a man
          on a proverbial treadmill my client was stuck. She was
          literally a prisoner of her mind, held captive by her own
          self-limiting belief system that dictated who she was and
          worse yet what she could accomplish.              
            Then what seemed like an extended period of time went
          by before I heard from her. One day she called and insisted
          that I visit her at once. When I arrived, she smiled with an
          ear-to-ear grin as she carefully handed me a newspaper.
            “What do you think?” she asked. As I glanced at the
          periodical, I could see that I was holding the local commu-
          nity college newspaper. My eyes began to scan the page but
          came to a screeching halt as they landed on a story by —

                                       Howard Rosenthal     
         you guessed it — my client. What came next was even more
         remarkable. Her story entitled No More Night Snooping was
         an article about … me! The piece talked about how I was
         representative of a new breed of caseworker who really tries
         to help the client rather than the typical caseworker of the
         past who visited the home at night to see if welfare mothers
         were hiding a man in the house.                    
            As I looked up, I detected tears in the eyes of my two
         neophyte students. I knew they understood. And that, my
         dear reader, is why I still help people. That’s why I keep
         coming back for more. Some people, even if they are a
         minority, do appreciate it. There are those whose lives we
         change forever — they know it and they cherish it. 
            This is a challenging field with rich emotional rewards.
         Hopefully these 55 key ideas, conspicuously missing from
         my own education, will help you avoid the land mines and
         guide you on your fascinating journey as a helper. Hey, let’s
         get together some time and swap emotional trophy closet
         stories.
